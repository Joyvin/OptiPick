Bristles are very soft but neck of brush is weak
I have sensitive gums plus a few fillings in my back teeth. This toothbrush has soft bristles thus gives a very soft touch while brushing. It cleans effectively and the quality of toothbrush is very good. I have been using it since a month and it still works the same way.
Quality and price is not reasonable little bit high
Everthing is just right, sized right, soft, good quality.
Good but some times it hurts gums.
One of the best toothbrush, at least for me. Cause this is the only toothbrush that cleans upper and lower inside of my tooth throughly. Only downside is,  bristles get worns out with in a month.
This is the worst toothbrush i have seen. It is not at all soft bristles. Moreover it is mere a designer brush and doesn't fulfill the requirement.I couldn't imagine that colgate manufacturing such useless toothbrush.Please don't buy.Thanks.
It's very convenient to use and extremely soft and comfortable while brushing teeth.You'll definitely feel the difference from regular toothbrush 🪥 available in market in range of 30-80₹.
My dentist recommended me brush with smaller head so that it reaches till wisdom teeth. This brush was a game changer for me. It's very soft and the grip is so good. With small head it reaches all areas. But the bristles should be a little short like the normal brushes.
Delivered  before the expected date . Smoothness of bristles is excellent which i didnt find in other tooth brush.
Nice packaging and good product
Getting fungus in few weeks. Had to throw away and order something else.
Expensive but bristles are made of natural fibres and Long lasting.
I like to use eco friendly products so tried many bamboo brushes but was not satisfied with the results.. My brother suggested me to try VRIDHE bamboo toothbrush.. And the results are lovely.. I love using them now.. And even my kid of 5 yrs also use VRIDHE bamboo toothbrush and he loves it.. Thank you VRIDHE 🥰💜
                    The media could not be loaded.                 Unlike few other bamboo toothbrushes that falsely claim "Activated Charcoal" with Nylon bristles, this one is genuinely different with it's plant fiber bristles, they are soft as well as efficient. Above all, this bamboo toothbrush made my brushing experience 100% sustainable.
Worthless Brushes
I have used bamboo toothbrushes earlier, but after using this, I can say these are the best of all that are available in market.
It feels so good to use the brush, bristles are so soft and perfectly designed. Moreover it's nature friendly and anyone looking for nice bamboo toothbrush can go with this.
                    The media could not be loaded.                 The product is good, bristles feel soft and effective as it's mentioned, above all I'm happy with my choice of switching from a plastic toothbrush to this bamboo toothbrush!
Excellent quality, yes value for money, perfect grip and amazing softness would recommend one and all to go for it.
Superb soft brush
Very soft Brussels, easy to handle and can move around
Good
Awesome soft brush
good toothbrush for easy manoeuvrability
Not so good
very nice toothbrush with soft bristles, and  value for money. I'll review it after a couple months of use.
I never knew tooth brush makes this huge difference. I have a habit of brushing post meals even though i have had swelling to my gums and when I visited dentist, he told u have no problem, your teeth and gums are perfect and suggested me this. I thought and doubted will this really help ? But anyway followed him. Its been more than 3 months and i did not face any issue till date.My prbm was some small particles were getting stuck in my gums and was causing swelling. Brushing teeth did not help me previously but when started using this,all my worries are gone. Im thankful that I found this one
It’s good
LikesThis toothbrush is awesomeCompactComfortableSoftLong lastingQuality Product

This brush has hard bristle but quality of the product is good but I can't recommend for everyone.
Ok.
These brushes are fine, not a very good quality. It stays for around a month if you use it properly for cleaning teeth. Not bad wither as compare to other same category toothbrushes.
Hard bristles toothbrush not made for Human being.Very poor quality
Nice
Everage
Better one ,Why not it's Oral B.
Ultra soft brushles
Very soft as said. I have been using it for quite some time now and compared to the other Colgate sensitive toothbrush I think I will prefer this as it is cheaper and does the job better than the other one. Definitely worth it.
The Colgate Gentle Enamel Ultra Soft Bristles Manual Toothbrush set has completely transformed my dental care routine! This pack of four, with the Buy 2 Get 2 offer, is an absolute steal for anyone prioritizing enamel protection and oral hygiene.The ultra-soft bristles are a game-changer! They delicately clean my teeth and gums without causing any discomfort or irritation. My enamel feels pampered and safeguarded with every gentle brushstroke, making this toothbrush perfect for daily use.The multicolored set not only looks appealing but also ensures each family member can have their own designated brush, maintaining hygiene standards effortlessly.I appreciate how these brushes cater to adults, acknowledging the specific dental needs of mature teeth. The attention to enamel care is commendable, and I’ve noticed a significant improvement in the health and brightness of my smile since using this set.Overall, Colgate has hit the mark with this ultra-soft bristles manual tooth.
Its incredibly soft bristles make brushing a delight, perfect for sensitive gums. The effective cleaning power and ergonomic design earn it a well-deserved five-star rating. This is the second time I have bought it.
I have extremely sensitive gums and this product is advertised as ultrasoft but it's not it's the same as the others, this causes discomfort and hurts my gums, so far the only good thing good about these is that they're a little broad which mean that I don't have to shift the toothbrush up and down while brushing but that's about it, they aren't soft at all, wish I could return them
Very soft bristles. Cleans good also . Quality is also nice . But I think it's bristles width should be decreased.
It is very softAnd is also goodI like the product
I must say after a long time got a good brush. The bristles are very soft on the gums and yet do the job well. The head is big enough to fit in all corners of the mouth covers the entire mouth properly. Great product
Too soft but do the job Its OK for three months maximum
Nice, you can go for it if you want.
I recently purchased this toothbrush, and I'm impressed with its design and functionality. The fact that it comes with a cap is a game-changer for me – it keeps the bristles clean and makes it easy to carry in my bag without worrying about hygiene. The toothbrush itself has a comfortable grip, and the bristles are gentle yet effective in cleaning. I appreciate the attention to detail in the design, and the cap is definitely a standout feature for me. If you're looking for a reliable toothbrush that also considers convenience, this is a solid choice!
Brush is good but there is no more charcoal.
Packaging was awful but the product is amazing... Those who want good cleaning go for it. 1st 1st you can feel like brush is bit hard but it's very good. the bristles are hard working... All over I love this charcoal brush specially for the price ❤️
Lower quality
Good 👍
Just perfect for medium bristles good enough to clean your tooth
Bad item. Number of bristles are less and hard. Wastage of money.
A delight to use
Good

Nice product
Good product value for money
Very good
Great product . I absolutely loved it
Price worthy
It's good for teeth 👌
Brushing now can be zig zag and painless.
The product is obviously good. But it was delivered without any outer packaging. Since the toothbrushes are meant to be for oral hygiene, it was extremely unpleasant to see it delivered as is. I expected it to be properly packed
Extraordinary Fantastic Mind-blowing product
It is not a soft  brush, brush quality is so hard, otherwise it is value  for money product.
Excellent product..soft and durable..
Satisfactory product
Good quality
It flares very fast, say, after a month or two, so there is no point in using this product, as there is no value for money, a toothbrush should last atleast 3 months
Awesome product
Dentist recommended carbon brush, not remaining I  shape even after just a few days of use ? Not expected from such famed brand Colgate?
I like this item and very happy from this shopping
Nice product but packaging not good.
Nice
Good durable and soft brush
Effectively removes plaque
These tooth brushes are very nice. I ordered these more than three times by now. My repeat orders are proof of my trust in these tooth brushes.
OralB's toothbrush holders are much better. The brush is excellent.
So hard and harsh on teeths
This is a slimsoft and charcoal toothbrushes. Since the day of purchase of the product. I am continuing to use it. I am very well satisfied with the used of the toothbrushes. The quality, softness, value of money and cleaning of the toothbrushes are too good. If you are not able to use hard tooth brush then go for soft slim tooth brush. It's money worth it. Thank you for reading this :)
It does not require any review.  Good product by Colgate .
I recently purchased the Colgate Slimsoft Charcoal Manual Toothbrush and got a fantastic deal with the "Buy 2, Get 2 Free" offer. The toothbrush is excellent, with its 17X slimmer tip bristles providing a thorough and gentle clean. The charcoal-infused bristles also leave my teeth feeling fresh and clean. The value for money is unbeatable, especially with the bonus of receiving four toothbrushes for the price of two. I highly recommend the Colgate Slimsoft Charcoal Manual Toothbrush for its effectiveness, affordability, and great deal.
So soft that my father don't use other toothbrushes
It’s very soft brush to care the whole mouth…
very comfort to use
Just OK product
I bought it for my wife and grandmother. They love the soft feeling of brush's hair.  Both are very satisfied with the product. A great purchase.
This toothbrush is really soft.

Oral-B once again proves its commitment to quality with this fantastic product. Highly recommended for those seeking a gentle yet effective brushing solution.
Deducted 1 star bcoz of misleading product image, otherwise bristles are super-soft.
Good
Misleading image.
nice
I have been trying all soft brushes but find them to be too hard to brush and damaging my tooth enamel also . But these r just soft and perfect the way I wanted . I got them for 147/- .
The sole purpose of purchasing this brush was that it had a tongue cleaner  , this is of just the same plastic , and did not had any rubber - because of this it is NOT friendly in cleaning ur tongue. . When coming to the looks, the looks of the brush- it feels u r using a inferior quality brush.Apart from this the brush is ok
Soft and smoothComfortable brushing
Best brush for sensitive gums
The toothbrushes are soft.
Must go for this toothbrush . Very nice toothbrush .
Very soft to use. Good quality and durable. Cleans teeth wonderfully. Value for money.
The Oral-B Pro Health Gum Care Soft Toothbrush has become our go-to choice for daily dental hygiene. Its consistent performance, combined with the value-packed offer, makes it a staple in our household. Without a doubt, this will remain a repeat purchase for us.
Great Toothbrush. Cleans the whole mouth and has a life of 2 months. Perfect. @160Rs. per pack of 4
Good
Comfortable one for people who are used to medium toothbrush
When it comes to our own oral health, I don’t compromise with the quality of toothbrush. This Pro health Gum care from Oral B is one of the finest manual toothbrush in the market till date.With its Crisscross bristles it removes plaque from almost each and every corner of our mouth and its soft gum stimulators on both the sides takes care of our gums at the same time. Another thing which makes it special is its round tip bristles, round tip ensures no harm to both our teeth and gums as compared to the sharp bristles in most of the brushes that can cause sensitivity issues. On back of the toothbrush a textured tongue cleaner is provided which really works unlike those which are provided just as a design.Yes, it costs a little higher but as I said we are buying this for our own oral health and in return it will cut our dentist bills. So, no need to worry it’s worth its price.P.S. I review products on amazon to help fellow customers in taking wise decisions and try to ensure that everyone's hard earned money get its full worth. It always makes my day to know that people find my reviews helpful. Feel free to comment for any queries.
Recommended by my dentist decades ago...I've never been satisfied with any other toothbrush since...possibly the best ones out there!Look no further, folks...this is IT!! To healthy teeth and gums....:)...n don't forget to floss!!
Very hard and rough bristles
Brush is very hard.
Pros ✅Soft bristlesDoes its purposeDurableAffordable when bought as packCon'sDuring winters, due to moisture the wood gets fungus which is very bad but if we keep them in sunlight then there is no issue
I brought these toothbrush just because it's handle is not made of plastic but bamboo. But the bristles are plastic so it's not a complete eco-friendly product but it's somewhat better than it's rivals.I've noticed some bristles will come off while brushing and till date I've seen a little amount of bristles losing from the handle.Handle is easier to hold and brush doesn't have any affect will Washing it.If you are a environment conservative and wants to make a plastic free life buy this product.
Great product at lowest price
This very bad brush I am used 3 days then punch my review this brush quality like not bamboo , very bad quality plastic used in this product, don't buy this product very very bad
Only handle is made from bambooBristles are made of plastic, so not 100% natural product as they claim.Bristles are not soft n comfortable.Handle is not ergonomic.But still can be used without guilt and less priced.
Quality was good
Due to bamboo it is not flexible so it's hard to use and bristle are not soft they make the tooth brush is very hard to use. Due to thisMany people will not buy it again. Maker have to do some job on this.
Good quality
Some more bristles - one more line on length side can make it super effective in cleaning the teeth
Should start our day with eco friendly products.better than the plastic toothbrush
Very Nice Product. Perfect Grip At The Time Of Brushing. Quality Of The Product Is Excellent. I Don't Know Why It Is Given The Softness Option. The Bristles Are Not Soft.
Very poor quality Brussels.The packet shown soft but the Brussels are quite hard.Price is fine with cap.
Very nice & soft it’s really good
I want super soft brush, with plain shape, not JigJag
Best price with good quality
Nice combo
Very useful for regular use and good product. Soft in use. Thank you so much 🙏

Great brush for sensitive teeth

Good brush, nice
No one should compromise with the quality of toothbrush because it’s the matter of our own oral health. This Sensitive whitening toothbrush from Oral B is a nice option for those having sensitivity issues.This toothbrush is especially made for sensitive teeth with soft bristles to avoid any pain. Another thing which makes it special is its round tip bristles, round tip ensures no harm to both our teeth and gums as compared to the sharp bristles in most of the brushes that can cause sensitivity issues. On back of the toothbrush a textured tongue cleaner is also provided but that's not a proper cleaner.One thing which you should be aware of while buying this is that although it’s soft but not an ultra-soft toothbrush. So, if you are suffering from extreme sensitivity then this is not the perfect toothbrush for you.P.S. I review products on amazon to help fellow customers in taking wise decisions and try to ensure that everyone's hard earned money get its full worth. It always makes my day to know that people find my reviews helpful. Feel free to comment for any queries.

Good
Satisfied in all aspects
Exactly as mentioned. Happy with the purchase :)
Value for money pack,
Product is best quality
I think these brushes were not upto the mark for money paid.The thread part of brush were too soft. May be company has reduced it's quality.
Been using ZigZag for a long time and never been disappointed!
Zigzag design seems to be giving more penetrating brushing !
superb product...must try...better than oral B brushes
Good one. Feel free and purchase
good quality was good.
Not good
Good sturdy brushes. Bristles are neither very hard nor very soft. Just perfect for use. I'm already using the number one. Good for sustainable living. Very nice packaging.
Panny, an unbiased reviewer.Comfort is very grippy to hold.Softness - It is really soft and yet able to clean your teeth because of the density of the bristles, I have had no problems so far with the bristles.The case provides a great look and easily protects it from outside, BUT the case may not last long, as it is supposed to be a bamboo case and it might start getting moisture and start to decay soon because when we put the brush inside the case, some water may leave on the toothbrush which may drip inside the case and leading to moisture buildup, which is not a problem in plastic toothbrush cases.So a great product overall, but do keep on checking inside of the case if any decay have happened or not.
I had used this product. This is my repeat purchase as we found the product to be as required by us.
If you're goal is Sustainability and you are Indian, then do not go for this product. Let's talk on both the points :1. Sustainability - The packaging from Amazon was made using cardboard, which is good but the product CLAIMS that its own packing i.e. The box whose picture you see is also Recyclable and "Biodegradable". Here comes the detailed study, just like Paper cups with Plastic layering, it's the same here! There are not many recyclers can recycle through our country. So a big NO.2. Manufacture / Made in - The product is Made in People's Republic of China, and I came to learn this after the product was delivered. Now since my goal is to be sustainability too, returning this product wouldn't cost me at all, but it will definitely cost Petrol, Time and Effort of my fellow Indians. And we all know how crucial fuel costs are.Hence don't fall for it, choose Indian and Sustainable product. The displayed product is good otherwise, but the bristles are too thin and soft which might directly poke in your gums. Handle is very well made.
I started using my first brush in Jan 14 and today on April 14 i am swtiching to my second brush as you can see from the photos the bristles are only slightly frayed ....thats after 3 months of use and thats just durability the real appeal is the softness of this brush... I have used Colgate,Oral-B and even dentists recommended soft brushes but all of them when you use them for the first time tend to hurt your gums but this didn't since they are made from natural material in addition to being eco friendly the soft and thin bristles go into all the crevixs of the teeth while not hurting the gums... all in all this is amazing i have recommended this to my entire family and i bough a second box just recently....100% worth every paise.
                    The media could not be loaded.                 Very Handy To Use And soft feel on teeth
Just go for it
I wanted to do my part for the environment, so I tried the Rusabl Organic Bamboo Toothbrush. Sadly, my experience was far from pleasant. After just a month of use, I noticed fungus growing on the wooden handle.Using a toothbrush with fungus is not hygienic and could be harmful to our oral health. I really wanted this eco-friendly option to work, but it let me down. I regret buying the Rusabl Organic Bamboo Toothbrush due to the fungus issue. Until the company fixes this problem, I cannot recommend this toothbrush to others. Our oral hygiene is essential, so it's best to choose a toothbrush without such problems.
Expensive
Good product
This very unique and good product. If you undergoing ortho dental treatment then this useful brush combo made specifically for this. Your local pharmacist surely will not have this variety. Go for it.
This toothbrush comes with a small size bristles at the end (towards handle of brush) of the toothbrush, which helps to clean the stucked food inside the braces which are not easily clean even rinsing the mouth after having food and a separate red colour little cleanser is also good in removing stucked materials inside the bracket (a part of braces only).
Wonderful purchase, Good to use with braces and wires on teeth. The brush was not spread even after 30 days of using it on braces teeth.
this brush comes with interdental brush helped me clean between my braces. I am satisfied with this brush..
Quick delivery
Super use for teeth clips users
It's very soft easy to brush with braces and helps alot to the patient of braces....Thankyou amazon....
Okay 👌
i thought brush bristles  are soft but they are very hard , on the sheet it has mentioned super soft but it is not , please take a look on this it is absolutely damaging the teeth ( each brush costed more than a 100)
Bit pricey but good
Brush is very soft and very easy to hold while brushing the teeths.As expected!!Purchased second time
Bristles are very soft. It’s a very good product. I liked it very much
                    The media could not be loaded.                 Recently ordered CARE CUB TOOTHBRUSHES.Product design is minimalist & feels premium in hand.Bristles are super soft & quite comfortable to use.MUST ORDER
They can reduce this brush price cause brush hasn't good finishing glue spilled on bristles ,many company offer this type of brush at the cheaper price but they charge double I don't know why
Very nice product. Use friendly product .Look very cool 😎

This toothbrush is good only for massaging your gums...it doesn't clean your teeth properly.
this is not a brush.i wasted my money on this.you can at best pat your tooth and gums using this.it is more like a cotton swab put on a handle.avoid at all cost, lol, buy a real toothbrush.
Soft and economical
The bristles are very soft and super gentle. The only thing I don't like is that it can be difficult to properly wash out all the toothpaste foam because it's so dense.
I have to scrub extra hard to get my teeth as clean as I would with a normal toothbrush, but it's not that bad since the bristles are very soft & it forces me to be more intentional while brushing. It is a much more comfortable experience than brushing with a normal brush.Note: if you have dentures or invisalign, these are very good brushes for cleaning them! Very gentle.
Other reviews say these toothbrushes are good, so I brought some and used it a couple of times. All they do is rub on your teeth, the water makes the bristles all compact and useless… don’t waste money
These are better than most brushes i've used.They are not built to last long i was estimate a new brush each month.I mean t hey arn't that expensive though
These toothbrushes are perfect to sweep dust. Not to brush between the teeth.
Soft + Thin Elongation makes it comfortable to use . This Model of sensodyne was not available in near by shops even I m user of this brands for more than 10 years

Lable says soft but bristles are pretty hard. Disappointed.
Good  product
Nice product. Value for money.
And price is of high and ofline market is best to buy this product and more cheaper
Good product, soft for teeth.
Quality.There is a price.
This one is really good!!
Toothbrush is soft but didn't last longer
Works well for those with sensitive teeth.
Neck part is too flexible to use. Useless for me.
I would like to suggest to everyone
Good quality.
Nice product
Durable, medium
If you are using soft brush before then dont even try these they r hard.
I really like Colgate Zigzag and have been using it since many years.At times I also tried using other and more expensive tooth brushes, but I still found this to be much better, than most.Main reason is the shape if the bristles which helps in cleaning between teeth properly.It comes in different types of bristles like Soft, Medium and Hard. Before buying check as per your requirements, as hard bristles may not be suitable for all.

No words to explain… it’s really great to grab it.

Some brushes were défective.

Valuable price and quality but just one thing I don’t like which is I have to purchase 3 pack together
Like the criss cross bristles which reaches every corner of the mouth
The brush brussels  is good for teeth,  that's why
it is a hard and uncomfortable brush, regret buying it ...
Excellent quality, yes value for money, perfect grip and amazing softness would recommend one and all to go for it.
Superb soft brush
Very soft Brussels, easy to handle and can move around

Awesome soft brush
good toothbrush for easy manoeuvrability
Not so good
very nice toothbrush with soft bristles, and  value for money. I'll review it after a couple months of use.
I never knew tooth brush makes this huge difference. I have a habit of brushing post meals even though i have had swelling to my gums and when I visited dentist, he told u have no problem, your teeth and gums are perfect and suggested me this. I thought and doubted will this really help ? But anyway followed him. Its been more than 3 months and i did not face any issue till date.My prbm was some small particles were getting stuck in my gums and was causing swelling. Brushing teeth did not help me previously but when started using this,all my worries are gone. Im thankful that I found this one
It’s good
These pack of 3 brush are really nice with nice colors are super soft brisels.
Good 👍
Different colours, kids like it. Bristles are as expected. Nice design. Grip is good.

Excellent
Too good
good one
Value for money, Good Quality
Brush bristles are soft and the top is just appropriate size, fits in my 2 years old's mouth comfortably. Quality is good.👍
I got her another brand brush, she would cry. Gave this a try. She is comfortable brushing now.
Oh! Seeing it in "the items to be reviewed next", I now remember that I have to order it again!My sensitive gums and teeth like this brand and siecificallybthis toothbrush only. If you are using it for the first time, you will be astonished to feel the difference. This toothbrush has almost feather like on the teeth. Please don't brush vigorously after this experience believing since this toothbrush is light, YOU have to be vigorous with your hand moments while cleaning and press it down on the molars hard. Don't. Just don't. When you feel it's not doing anything, just know it is cleaning just as effectively as a good normal toothbrush while being gentle on your gums as if you are a baby.To check its effectiveness,  after you are done brushing, use your tongue to check for any layer on teeth. You won't find any. Because the toothbrush did its job. This feather like experience would reduce with regular usage. Faster if you brush thrice daily sometimes, which you totally should.After some time, when you see the bristles bent left and right, it is time to change the brush. You would feel it too after brushing as if you need to brush again. It's a good thing it comes in a packs of 3, I am good for months. Was great during lockdown.Pro tip -( if you are buying a 2 toothbrush pack) When you proceed to discard 1st brush of this ORAL b packet and move to second, dont throw the 1st one in the dustbin. Keep and store it in some drawer. This is because if you drop the 2nd (new) brush by mistake and it can't be used anymore, you don't have to go to a different brand or a different toothbrush in this emergency situation. Till the time your next packet is delivered to you, You can use the stored brush..This is because since your mouth became used to this feather like soft toothbrush, and your hand motions also became light, any change in brand is going to be rough on your gums and teeth.In case if 3 toothbrush pack, when you move to the 2nd toothbrush store the 1st one. When you move to the 3rd toothbrush fromnyhe same packet, store 2nd and now throw in the dustbin the first one.Hope it was useful

Good product if you want to use soft brushes
Quality is good and too soft. I guess it's perfect for kids, it won't affect on kids teeth.
Excellent best international standard product and packaging. Highly recommended.
Best price, its one in two tongue cleaner is easy to used and its materials are good, soft and easy to cleaned.
Satisfactory product

Brush is very hard and difficult to use. Gums will pain..
Very good product
Good toothbrush in this range
Jitne mehenge ye brush hai utne ye chalte nahi hai.. mere pass ye 2 mahine ke andar bekar ho gaye.. pese ispe waste na kre
Very hard bristles
Got worst product. One item used. Can I send back remaining 3?
It costs a bomb compared to regular brushes, but does justify in terms of soft bristles and overall durability.
The toothbrush is soft but not as soft as I expected and concourse a bit pricey. I also found that in the top part of the brush the bristles were long compared to the bottom part..which for me was a little uncomfortable while brushing.otherwise overall good product
Luckily I got the brush in good condition. The bristles are super soft and if you've sensitive teeth and gums then I would recommend this brush. I have constant problem of cleaning my wisdom tooth. Often I experience pain due to the plaque formation in the gum pockets near the wisdom tooth. This brush was able to reach the corner of the mouth gently removing the debris from the gums. Other brushes will usually cause bleeding while doing it. But this one is a blessing. So far no other brand could beat oral b in producing soft and affordable brushes. Go for it if you like to gently clean your teeth and gums.
Good with soft brushes
Softness is upto the mark. I am using other brand toothbrush of same price which is very soft.
There isn't different much between colget charcoal brush and this oral b brush but you can try this brush for perfect cleaning.
One of the best toothbrush i have used. Go for it. Value for money.
Yes you can buy it. Good quality, soft, safe for gums. With charcoal 😀. Although I don't know, how helpful this charcoal paint is, for our teeth. Yes you can use it as an indicator of good quality product.
If you have weak teeth or sensitive gums I would like to recommend you this. I have tried others pretty much and this is the only one in the market that meets my expectation quite close.
                    The media could not be loaded.                 After using many soft toothbrushes, I can say this is the best available in the market. Have used colgate 17x thinner bristles Chorcoal, but the problem with that is the imperfect infused bristles! Often they come out and looks very cheap! But this Oral-B has perfect fitted bristles and very firm on teeth due to its wider arranged bed. I definitely recommend this to everyone.
Awesome 💯
Ok ok product
After use for 4, 5 times, the bristles loose their tensile strength, what use then. Never expected a product of this poor quality from Colgate stable).
Likr
Its all good strong sturdy medium bristles. Cleans well and colgate trademark is just enough to explain the quality of the product.
Good product.  My family uses Colgate dental products till today and has found them to be most favourable for us over other brands.  I most certainly recommend Colgate. Thanks.
Velue for money
कोई खास नहीं
Just like normal toothbrushes nothing else. Neem word is only use for marketing and to color bristles.Packaging was not good I received broken plastic cover, so it should be wrapped in bubble wrapper...
Just as shown in the image. Soft on the teeth too.
I wanted to buy it since 4 months but I couldn't because the seller was not selling a single piece, it was a set of 4. Other sellers were asking 80 Rs delivery charges for single unit. Atlast on 30th April I saw that a seller is selling a single piece without any delivery charges. I Ordered it at once and as a Prime memeber I received it the next day. Now about the Toothbrush it's ultra soft and has a good grip. You can enjoy brushing your teeth. The Design and colour are very attractive. Overall I wanna say just try it and you gonna love it. After Colgate 360 this is a class one toothbrush.
Very smooth
I am sure if you use this brush once, you will never ever like any other brushBristles are perfectly soft and cleans teeth very wellHighly satisfied with this product
Good Services / Items.
Nice and gorgeous design. Good quality.
I have using this for 2 month, it is soft and good to your gum. But I got black strain on my teeth. So go for soft not ultra soft. It won't clean the black strain.
I hv been using a hard or medium tooth brush heretofore causing a painful abrasion and cavity in my upper premolars. As usual the dentist advised to get the tooth extracted which I did not agree to. I then ordered for this piece of brush and it penetrated deep into the gaps and cleaned it perfectly due to which the pain and discomfort were soothed and even after two years I need not go for an extraction. This is a good piece and worth its price which is quite reasonable.
                    The media could not be loaded.                 Brush is not ok 😭 brisaless r not ok
It was recommended by my doctor for gum treatment and so far I am quite satisfied
Like this toothbrush.It is soft and gentle to the teeth.Price is a bit on a higher side though..
Head of toothbrush is small. Not as expected from the picture shown on Amazon.
pack of 3 toothbrushes - made of bamboo, and you get slight smell of neem oil as the handles are treated with that to prevent fungal growth - 3 separate marks on toothbrushes so that you dont mix it up amongst your family members. All in all, very thoughtfully designed.bristles are soft. packaging is great and price point is excellent - proves that sustainability is not expensive.
The bamboo option is not bad !
Eco friendly products always good, strongly recommend this product, very nice product, soft brussels.
I was searching for bamboo toothbrush and found this. Is it good looking and light weight and does its job.
Very good quality of the brush and it is also durable
After using this brush I can feel it myself that what I have been using my whole life .It works greatIt's so softDoesn't hurt your gumsAs the dentist suggest use soft bristelsIt's that only
Biodegradable
Very nice brush. No harm to teeth
This tooth brush is absolutely eco friendly and we can rest assured that we are not adding any plastics to the environment!
3 natural toothbrush for only 99, it’s a steal
I have been using this book for the past 10 years. I can say, these brushes last long. The bristles are soft enough for good teeth cleaning. Works well with the Sensodyne repair and protect toothpaste.
Good  and efficient brush design
Softness
Easy to use and effective.It’s strong and comfortable grip makes it last longer
I have got the sensitivity issue and bleeding gums, tried a lot of other toothbrushes but all failed except this miraculous toothbrush, the bristles are ultra soft and durable.
This is one of the worst toothbrushes from Sensodyne. Middle of the brush is all hollow may be it’s good for others, don’t know how they came up with such design but it didn’t work for me. It barely cleans your teeth and instead makes your gums bleed as the longer bristles poke your gums while brushing.
Good to use
It looks nice ! Softness is not up to the mark . The brush is bigger than it appears
Quality product
It's not original product,First copy productVery poor quality
It is a good brush. It lasted for close to 3 months before it deformed and I had to buy a new one. It is soft and the grip of the handle is very good.
Good
Nice grip
It's a brush.
The handle is so thick, it wont fit standard toothbrush-holders / stands. The brush is sloping forward, strange feel in the mouth; I guess it will take getting used to. Thorough brushing, nice clean feel after brushing.
I have been searching for this toothbrush in stores but couldn't find one. Thanks to Amazon for this. I love the fact that it has tonguecleaner at the back and the quality is top notch. There are so many brushes with tongue cleaner nowadays but none of those can be compared to this brush. Amazing design and quality.

ALWAYS VALUE FOR MONEY

I have been using Oral B Toothbrush for a long time.  I find it very good.  I can strongly say Oral B is my favorite.
Good one...i have been using it since very long
I've read a couple other reviews about how the "new" version of this brush felt like a locally produced one, and unfortunately that's true. I've been using this brush for several years now, and can confirm the quality of this version is below par, and the difference is visible and felt while brushing. Will try procuring this from an offline retailer, but disappointing that Amazon is selling a sub par product.
Nice
Very very hard bristles.. Cant even complete the brushing first time... Hurts your gums..
Its a very sturdy and comfortable good affordable toothbrush set. The bristles are perfectly comfortable, not to stiff not too soft. Thank you...
Very good quality brush
Keep smiling
A bit hard on teeth
I have using oral - b for past few years, I like the softness. After receiving this one I was terribly shocked that it was very very hard and there is no softness..Waste of money.. Don't buy this
Good condition
I usually buy Oral B’s pro-health gum care toothbrush but this time “Neem extract” branding got my attention. Priced at a similar value, this brush claims to contain Neem extract in its bristles. Here’s my take on this special brush.This brush is exactly same to the regular Oral B Po-health toothbrush which means you get the same rubberized tongue cleaner, rubberized grip to hold, flexible neck and crisscross bristles for enhanced cleaning. The only thing that is different apart from its colour is the presence of “Neem extract”. Frankly speaking, it’s just a marketing gimmick, and let me tell you why I feel so. Firstly, this neem extract is present only in crisscross bristles and that too 0.5% of the bristle’s weight, so clearly that’s not going to make any difference. Leaving this special feature aside, another thing that needs special mention is hardness of its bristles. These bristles are too hard and will surely make your gums bleed, so better go with the soft variant rather than medium.Overall, I would say that 4 units at 130 bucks is a great deal but don’t buy it considering the “Neem extract” tagline.P.S. I review products on amazon to help fellow customers in taking wise decisions and try to ensure that everyone's hard-earned money gets its full worth. It always makes my day to know that people find my reviews helpful. Follow me to read more informative reviews like this.
Bristles are hard!
Value for money.
GOOD ONE
I am a user of this electric tooth brush over 5 years now. I have been regularly using this and the brush heads are always available on amazon unlike some other brands. This is affordable and is healthy as well. I have no gum problems or tooth issues from I started using this.
Even after some mixed reviews I was also too confused while ordering this. Please go for it if you planning to buy. It’s absolutely perfect.
Product is good... But price is increased with extra sticker, for a old model product attachment...
Oral B, Dental care products, world wide have reputation and one get confidence while using their electric tooth brush or Battary operated.  Many  models available in department stores also in Amazon On line shopping, to suit everyone’s budget. One can always get the replacement brush heads. I suggest, to keep the stock of brush heads of family pack, which is economical. Let us all have a beaming smile.
It feets right into the brush holding body. But the blister packaging is not perfect so that the bristles bend with the packaging.
👌
Good Stuff.. bus price kam ker do yaar....
The Oral B Toothbrush Replacement Heads I bought recently for my Oral-B Cross Action Battery Powered Electric Toothbrush that  I have been using last 5 months 2 times a day. The brush heads last longer but for hygienic reasons I preferred to replace them every 2 months. Previously I had one of the Oral-B expensive versions, the Oral-B Vitality 100 White Criss Cross Electric Rechargeable Toothbrush for adults which had an unreplaceable battery, that lasted less than 9 months and I was required to spend again approx 1350 on purchasing a new Electric Brush. Instead, I bought an Oral-B Cross Action at Rs 499 only which allows me to change Brush-heads and batteries whenever needed. Sometimes cheaper versions prove more efficient. Don't you agree?

I got this product at a good deal from Amazon.Good quality product and using it from last month.Till this time brush bristles are great and no tilting or damages.Easy to handle and tongue cleaner at backside is ok but not perfect.Overall it's good.
Softness is not up to the mark..... otherwise good.
Good packing and best brushes under budget
It was written shop but brush is not soft at all. Who have sensitive gum n teeth pls dnt buy
Purchased it because it is advertised on the packet as soft bristles. It’s not bristle, its basically a bunch of copper wires. Haven’t come across a harder brush. It will definitely remove the plaque and also the enamel protecting one’s teeth. It is better suited for cleaning utensils. Never going to buy it ever again.The wastage of money didn’t hurt, its the total disregard for customers well-being from a brand like Oral-B, that is worrisome.
They are best toothpastes i have ever seen.Soft on gums and hard on germs.Really ver good product.
Great for the price... But it's not That soft.
Nice brushe...using it from last 3-4 years. Best brush 👍
Very bad bristles quality
The idea is good but the bristles are Medium-Hard, not Soft as labeled. My teeth became sensitive and the gums started receding after using them for a few days and had to discontinue their use. Now i use these brushes for household cleaning - like floor corners, sliding window channels, tile grouts, etc!!
Excellent product
Nice product
It's hard not gentle soft as mentioned.
Don't go for this product actual price of 5 tooth brush is 199 and they are selling it in 109rs and also quality is very bad. The product is china manufactured , they are selling very old product as there is mentioned import date October 2021.

Not feel so good

This is good for medium. Not a soft one.
Its ok brush, for the price you pay. Doesn't clean properly, so waste of money.
Does the job👍
Extra soft only use this toothbrushNice and good product
I don’t know if everyone would like the extra softness of the bristles. I found it ok and even liked it after a couple of days. How’s long will it last … wait and see it’s only the third day of brushing!
Good quality
I like it very well because the brush is very soft and cleanse very well. Thanks for the manufacturer
Out of the 3 brushes , the bristles of only 1 turns out ultra smooth. Remaining 2 are invariably medium to hard. I realised it after buying it a couple of times. Clever way of cheating customers......
Excellent item. Prompt delivery.

Good sturdy brushes. Bristles are neither very hard nor very soft. Just perfect for use. I'm already using the number one. Good for sustainable living. Very nice packaging.
Panny, an unbiased reviewer.Comfort is very grippy to hold.Softness - It is really soft and yet able to clean your teeth because of the density of the bristles, I have had no problems so far with the bristles.The case provides a great look and easily protects it from outside, BUT the case may not last long, as it is supposed to be a bamboo case and it might start getting moisture and start to decay soon because when we put the brush inside the case, some water may leave on the toothbrush which may drip inside the case and leading to moisture buildup, which is not a problem in plastic toothbrush cases.So a great product overall, but do keep on checking inside of the case if any decay have happened or not.
I had used this product. This is my repeat purchase as we found the product to be as required by us.
If you're goal is Sustainability and you are Indian, then do not go for this product. Let's talk on both the points :1. Sustainability - The packaging from Amazon was made using cardboard, which is good but the product CLAIMS that its own packing i.e. The box whose picture you see is also Recyclable and "Biodegradable". Here comes the detailed study, just like Paper cups with Plastic layering, it's the same here! There are not many recyclers can recycle through our country. So a big NO.2. Manufacture / Made in - The product is Made in People's Republic of China, and I came to learn this after the product was delivered. Now since my goal is to be sustainability too, returning this product wouldn't cost me at all, but it will definitely cost Petrol, Time and Effort of my fellow Indians. And we all know how crucial fuel costs are.Hence don't fall for it, choose Indian and Sustainable product. The displayed product is good otherwise, but the bristles are too thin and soft which might directly poke in your gums. Handle is very well made.
I started using my first brush in Jan 14 and today on April 14 i am swtiching to my second brush as you can see from the photos the bristles are only slightly frayed ....thats after 3 months of use and thats just durability the real appeal is the softness of this brush... I have used Colgate,Oral-B and even dentists recommended soft brushes but all of them when you use them for the first time tend to hurt your gums but this didn't since they are made from natural material in addition to being eco friendly the soft and thin bristles go into all the crevixs of the teeth while not hurting the gums... all in all this is amazing i have recommended this to my entire family and i bough a second box just recently....100% worth every paise.
                    The media could not be loaded.                 Very Handy To Use And soft feel on teeth
Just go for it
I wanted to do my part for the environment, so I tried the Rusabl Organic Bamboo Toothbrush. Sadly, my experience was far from pleasant. After just a month of use, I noticed fungus growing on the wooden handle.Using a toothbrush with fungus is not hygienic and could be harmful to our oral health. I really wanted this eco-friendly option to work, but it let me down. I regret buying the Rusabl Organic Bamboo Toothbrush due to the fungus issue. Until the company fixes this problem, I cannot recommend this toothbrush to others. Our oral hygiene is essential, so it's best to choose a toothbrush without such problems.

Nice tooth brushes
Good value multi-pack, nice and soft.
Excellent product
Very poor quality.. Did not last more than a week
The bristles are indeed soft but the cleaning of gums does not happen due to the size and shape of brush-head that looks okay visibly but awkward when used.
i like this colgate product to be used
It's ok
Brushing ok
It's not zig zag brush
Economical toothbrush.. Just Colgate branding..The colgate zig zig is having one of the fine toothbrush having the nice shape as well as the teeth get proper care with this toothbrush.Nice Tooth brush at this price, item as described in the description, good value for MoneyAmazon services is really awesome ...
Worth for money
Dislike., why extra tax is taken
The bristles are not soft at all.I bought it thinking they will be soft but they aren't. It is really hard on your teeth.i will not buy it again whatsoever.
Low quality bristles not even
It s very comfortable to use
My son has had sensitive teeth for a long time and we have been using these toothbrushes since he was four or five. They are really good. Soft yet works very well. Easy to place on a rack!
Ok type
While I’m conscientious about getting a new toothbrush every three months, I’m not at all picky about what brand of toothbrush I purchase. They’re all pretty much the same, right? Wrong! There’s a huge difference in the quality of this Colgate 360 toothbrush compared to the bargain/generic ones I often purchase.My dentist recommends soft bristles, but they can seem a little…wimpy. While this is a soft bristle brush, it’s designed for optimum reach and cleaning. I feel like I can easily clean the entire surface of the tooth with this brush and yet it’s gentle enough to clean along the gumline without causing irritation. The handle has a comfortable, non-slip grip.Bottom Line: Excellent toothbrush that provides thorough, gentle cleaning.
Disappointed as Amazon clearly stated SOFT in the Colgate 360 Floss tip toothbrushes and have sent MEDIUM toothbrushes. The No Return policy on this product renders my purchase absolutely useless. Money down the drain..
I am a user of colgate charcoal toothbrush. I thought of making change to this one. However, not only does it feel harsh on teeth, it is not able to clean properly. I had to throw it away and get back to my charcoal toothbrush to get my white teeth back.
The brushes are of soft category which is quite disliked by me. Although some people prefer soft brushes for their teeth and gums health but I quite disliked it. The soft brushes doesnt last much longer at all. After 1 month you have to buy a new one.
I am using this product for long now, my preference. You can try I hope you will not disappointed
Must buy product .. try once
Not in par with industry norms. A waste product.
Excellent
For traveling
Got year feb.2021 manufacturing product.Got damaged Brush and there is no exchange or return policy. Tried so many times to take and upload the pics of brush but could not upload it.

Found the bristles hard.
Very happy with the product and quality.
These brushes are good.
Soft as expected. Unique with thousands of brush sticks. Great product
Brush head is ideal only for kids under 12years; worst part is if you order to try out the product - you can order a minimum of 2. Hence wasted money on 2 brushes

This is the first time that I'm using this type of brush. I've been using it for 4 days. I will be updating my impressions after 1 month or so.Impression after 4 days: The cleaning action is the best I've experienced till now. It cleans so well and you can feel the difference in the breath. It is very gentle on the gums, so my mouth is generally feeling better since I started using it. I don't know how long 1 brush will be in useable condition. Will update.
pack of 3 toothbrushes - made of bamboo, and you get slight smell of neem oil as the handles are treated with that to prevent fungal growth - 3 separate marks on toothbrushes so that you dont mix it up amongst your family members. All in all, very thoughtfully designed.bristles are soft. packaging is great and price point is excellent - proves that sustainability is not expensive.
The bamboo option is not bad !
