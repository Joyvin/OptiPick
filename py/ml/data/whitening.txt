Daybreak is definitely one of best brands for dental care! I use their electric toothbrush and was intrigued to use their other products. The teeth whitening strips comes in package of 28 strips for 14 treatments. I’ve started using it and have started seeing minor difference. You can try this if you’re looking for teeth whitening products in the market.
The best product i used till yet for teeth whitening, amazed
not that effective as hydrogen peroxide whitening strips but works quite well
This product makes high quality teeth whitening accessible to everyone. This products have teeth strip pouches individually packed for each usage. One pouch contains two strips for upper and lower teeth. You just need to insure that your teeth are clean and dry and then stick the strips. Wait for 30 minutes and then remove the strips. The teeth will be somewhat noticeably whiter with each usage. Do this two times daily and then see the results. The quality of the product is very good. Daybreak is now my favorite dental brand. I usage it's toothbrush, toothpaste and teeth whitening solutions. I have also used the pen whitening solution.Go for it. I will also make sure to update this review after my long term review.
It might be helpful only if strips stick on teeth. It is difficult to stick them on teeth due to saliva in mouth.
Hard to apply & not for big teeth
it is easy to use but you have to be consistent as it is written on the box that you have to do this twice in a day then you can see the improvement otherwise not
The product is just miracle, its a boon for all the user who are having red or yellow teeth due to some bad eating habits.Its enamle free as well as its cruelty and peroxide free.The packaging is also nice, and the gum used to stick to your teet is also of good quality.The usage is also like 3 year old child can also use this.
Strips smell good ..we only used one strip so far but the quality  of adhesive is bad .it comes off and it's not convenient
It was my first time in trying any dental beauty products. I was sceptical at first but was excited to try this thing out. It’s been more than a week and it’s very easy to fit into my routine. I’m seeing effects for sure and I love the minty breath it leaves me with. One thing, I’d request the makers is - to give customers like a continuity plan. What do we do after the 2-3 weeks? I’d love to get a subscription if there’s a plan in place :))))) actually, :D
Good for your health teeth 😊
How can be this kind of products are available in Amazon. It doesn't work as claimed. It has liquid gel which only freshens your breath doesn't work in whitening of your teeth. Take my genuine suggestions don't waste your money buying this useless product. 10 rupees toothpaste is better than this. I would have given 0 stars if it is there.
Good
I really like how convenient It is to use. It gives a very natural finish to your teeth. Also, it works as a mouth freshner which is really great.
Just tried this teeth whitening pen from protouch and I'm OBSESSED!  I've been using it for a few weeks now, and I'm absolutely loving the results. It's easy to use and has definitely helped me achieve a brighter, whiter smile. This little gem is a game changer, providing noticeable results in no time. It's compact, easy to use, and perfect for on-the-go touch-ups. If you're looking for a quick and effective way to enhance your smile, look no further!
I have used this product for a week or 10 days and didn't see any dynamic difference as mentioned in the other reviews with the first usage itself. Plus it very inconvenient to use. One has to keep on clicking the button given on the other side for the help to come out and since the gel is less in quantity, so by this rapid clicking chances are there that it may fall into your basin. Although I am thinking of giving it another shot to see the so called effective results mentioned in the other reviews. But so far I have not came cross this whitening result after first usage itself. Further, the freshness thing after usage was because of mint or menthol type ingredient which I didn't felt from second or third usage onwards. This might be helpful with your purchase for this item.
Worst product u can ever useDon’t purchase this
It was superb and gave me results with २ weeks
This pen made my teeth clear or I can say white after using it for some time, I can say that it's a good product. I can smile with confident! Thanks seller for a fine product.
This pen made my teeth clear. i have been using this for sometime now and it really does work.
It didn't make my teeth feel sensitive. It's safe for your enamel and gets rid of stains on your teeth. After using it a few times, I saw a big improvement in how white my smile was.
very nice product must buy ..best serum for teeth whiteningi will be using this on regular basis
Loved the packaging and amazing results
Effective results. Feels so fresh after use
Works well and good
Not a good one as per ratings. No use of this product.
It's totally not working properly wasted of money 👎👎 very disappointed  I want my money back waste product
The serum is incredibly easy to apply
It gives real results
                    The media could not be loaded.                 This product is very goodAnd it is removed stain from teethI am very much appreciated by this
I really love this product for over the time use it has really changed the colour of my teeths I have using this from last15 days, visible difference observed in teeth shade.This is a great product. It work amazingly for teeth whitening. Its pocket friendly and do what it says.
Been using teeth whitening combo for a week and so far been pleasantly surprised. Seeing some results. Lets see how it turns out to be after 2 weeks.
It will work if your teeth aren't having long time paleness but if someone has yellowness for along time it might not completely give you whitening
The formula is very harsh like you can use it but there will be a problem but with your salivary gland saliva produce is so much or saliva that automatically the the term of your mouth will remove it and then you will feel like okay let's give it a try and it will never be like many like many try it will be successfull you need  good amount of patients to do that I won't recommend this if you guys really want to try it send your wish your money to everything you want but if you don't want to waste your money don't buy this I think the purple toothpaste that everyone were showing a network in trend you should do that actually I haven't tried it but I know it would be better
There's a noticeable difference I saw after using these strips. My teeth became visibly whiter and stains started to fade within days. The promise of clinic like results at home is no exaggeration. Also I love the color theme they've chosen and the packaging is sleek and well-designed it matches the premium quality of the product.
The pen and strip combo is mind blowing, reduced the yellowness of my teeth. The pen is super handy and I carry it with me everywhere.
You need shiny teeth to go with a shiny personality like mine and I'm so happy I have something for it now. It really helps me get my shine on...😍🤓love it this product
Full of freshness and removes stains also... Good for traveling recommended to all....Go for itAmazing results
The product is very nice. It works amazingly. I just loved this teeth whitening pen. Quality is very good. Easy to use and long-lasting. Value for money.
Great packaging and amazing product, super easy to use and already starting to see results
I recently bought the BIOVEDA Teeth Whitening Powder, and I have to say, it totally exceeded my expectations! This teeth whitener is a total game-changer when it comes to getting a brighter smile, and what's even better is that it's enamel-safe. The first thing that caught my attention was its all-natural formula. I'm really conscious about using harsh chemicals, so I loved that it's made from activated charcoal and other natural ingredients. It made me feel at ease knowing that I'm using a safe and gentle product on my teeth.Using the powder was a breeze, and I was genuinely amazed by the immediate results after just a few uses. It really did a fantastic job lifting surface stains, leaving my teeth noticeably whiter and brighter. And as a bonus, it even helped reduce plaque and freshen my breath!Overall, I'm super happy with the BIOVEDA Teeth Whitening Powder, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an effective and safe way to whiten their teeth. It's definitely worth every penny
At first i was lil worried to try something new of such category as I'm too picky when it comes to dental health, but when I tried it I was really impressed by the improvement of overall dental health.
                    The media could not be loaded.                 I am kinda customer who never takes an effort to write a review usually but team BioVeda you guys are killing it, 365 white just became my daily driver for fresh good mornings and the best part is i am less worried of what i eat because you guys make my teeth brighter every week, i have seen my gum bleedings have stopped as wellCan’t thank you enough, much love to team BioVeda
The ingredients are the key for this product and anyone can see the results from day1.
Good
I brought this product after the reviews of amazon.but we can see the result on first day...as per the directions I used...it gave fresh feel to the mouth also
Used it twice a day with no results
I have been using this powder from past few days , All the yellowness over my teeth has goneUse twice for faster results 👍
Amazing product..affective from the very first use..no. Need to spend hefty dentist fees for teeth whitening Problems..⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Bioveda teeth whitening powder is a very good product for whitening your teeth. My teeth have been shining since I have used this product.It really helped me to whiten my teeth.I strongly recommend using this as it is pocket friendly also.
I have been using it for 1 month, and I can see the difference in the shades of my teeth,Also using it twice a day removes bad odour from mouth and stays longer for hours
I purchased this 3 month ago & i use this consistently, in the first month I see visible results like my yellow stain is too dark but it's not completely remove the yellow stain but it gets better & light 2 shades.
                    The media could not be loaded.                 I was having a bit yellowish teeth and I was afraid to get bad photos in my marriage. So I bought this tooth powder in spite of going for any dental cleaning. This does miracle.. my teeth were brightest of ever my photos were just wow.. I laughed with my fullest on my wedding.Must buy
It's been over 10-12 days since I started using this product and to be honest I couldn't see any changes.Before I started using this, I got my teeth cleaned by the dentist however there were a few yellow stains on my teeth and I thought this could help me with that. Since I consume a lot of coffee and tea, my teeth stain very easily.Ever since I started using this product, I have reduced my caffeine intake, I have also started brushing my teeth thrice a day, I drink a lot of water, and more than usual but still I can't see any visible change.I don't know what to say, I read reviews of this product before buying it, and since most people have given positive reviews, I decided to go for it.Well, I am gonna keep using it for a month and see if this really works.
I really like this powder, it keeps your mouth fresh and makes us feel fresh. I love the product.
It's really good for yellow teeth but it take 1 week to see results
I have been using this for quite some time now, honestly there is no comparison to this product. It removed tarnish and whiten my teeth and keeps me fresh with fresh breath. I request everyone to try.
It’s not something works like magic it’s take months to whiten your teeth over all a good product
Superb product
Bought for mother seems like a good product so far
This is perfect tongue cleaner with goodness of copper. This is so much sturdier and better than the plastic tongue cleaners. Definitely recommend.
Just purchased the Perfora serum. Packaging is minimal and compact, to the point. Will share a detailed feedback after using the product.
I recently tried the Perfora Teeth Serum and it has completely transformed my oral care routine.
I am using this serum and I found real benefits
This is not worth the price it is not a toothpaste that we can use two times a day it is a colour corrector serum. Colour corrector is supposed to work instantly, and serums doesn’t need to be used on TEETH twice daily. The above photos is the before and after before being the photo on top and after on bottom it shows no difference whatsoever. And if i use it twice daily it would be finished in less than a week.The only thing good about it is the smell and it also leaves a sensitivity in your teeth.Very bad product i regret it I thought it was actually colour corrector but it is just a purple non cleaning mouth freshener nothing else!And fyi i tried it twice first time i did it like we use a toothpaste brushed for 2 minutes and second time I applied it and left it on for 5 minutes then spit it out didn’t even rinse my mouth thoroughly so that it doesn’t rinse off snd it doesn’t show any results.Don’t buy this rather go to a dentist and get teeth whitening done if ur that rich because neither does this cleans ur teeth nor does it whitens them it just leaves a freshened smell which can be achieved by mouth fresheners and a cold sensitivity .
It works as it says
This is really a good product.
I used n result was impressive but after sometime I have a sharp sensitivity with pain in teeth. May be it's side effects to me. So, I would recommend this quality product surely but consult with doctor also once if u have any sensitivity issue or even not.
Im using lavendar for past one month and really liked the product especially the energising and refreshing flavour it's leaves in your mouth, for teeth whitening you need to be patient as it's a long term process. The lemon flavour is one of my favourite and gets me fresh in the morning
If you are looking for teeth whitening product then this one is must try... It will give you visible results. Try it.
Such a amazing product with 14 teeth whitening strips  it's easy to use and make teeth white immediately must check this out.
I have tried it for 6-7 days, there is a difference that is observed, I shall update it post usage for 14 days
                    The media could not be loaded.                 I recently tried this AGARO Dazzle Instant Teeth Whitening Kit with 14 Pcs Strips,  for the first time and i am using it now since 8-9 days and seeing good results in my teeth actually... and This is Manual Dental Whitening Kit for adults, Oral Care, 24 Blue LED Light, Rechargeable, Removes Teeth Stains, Non Sensitive, Gentle & Safe and believe me this is worth buying ✨❤️🫶🏻

Just got delivered today! I am excited to use it for myself see the very first result as i am a coffee drinker. Will update in a while with before and after pictures of the very first test round.Update couple hours later at night , so i was done eating dinner and as instructed in the manual after teeth whiting dont eat anything for an hr .1) read manual (dont brush teeth before)2) open the strips packet (2 strips)3) apply lower one first then top4) there was no indication (atleast i couldn't find it)Which strip show go up or down / long strip or short strip . So i went with instinct  used the longer for top and shorter for bottom5) carefully peel the strip from the packaging and careful they r sticky so they roll up at then end like tape and stick together. So plz be careful so u dont waste strips.  Apply on6) once u have changed the uv device and cleaned with hot water to sanitiser (not boiling) place it in ur mouth with the power button facing upwards.7) first round 30mins, i kept for 20 i ran out of patience hehehe (it has a self timer but u also much check ur watch)8) during this process this will make u drool alot ( accumulation of saliva in ur mouth) go spit it out.9) once done peel the tape from ur teeth and throw in the dustbin.....gargle and wash ur mouth properly and if u feel sickness lightly brush ur teeth and wash ur mouth.10) all clean teeth .... good for a week
                    The media could not be loaded.                 It is very effective & usefull product.easy to use.it comes with 14 pcs  whitening strips.24 blue led light remove deep stains from the tooth.easy to carry...& make s gorgious smile..
                    The media could not be loaded.                 I have tried for the first time and I have measured my teeth color with the card first then after few usage I have seen the difference.
Initially i used it for 10 mins once per day, there was little to no change for 2 days then i started using it for 30 mins once per day. And it did whiten my teeth upto 2 shades in a week. Sometimes my teeth would look 2 shade whitened sometimes they'd look 3 and sometimes there were no change at all. And it would look like they used to. Then i googled how often should i use whitening strips which said twice a day, only then i started noticing significant change upto 7 shades in 2-3 weeks. I have sensitive teeth but this didn't trigger my sensitivity at all even after 30 mins. Must be because process is slow but it does work.P.s. they should tell us what percentage of hydrogen peroxide is present in the strips so we can judge better.
Hey there! So, let's talk about the Urban Botanics Activated Charcoal Teeth Whitening Powder. 🖤✨This product has gained quite a bit of popularity lately, and I can see why. People have been raving about its teeth whitening effects. 🦷😁The activated charcoal in the powder helps to remove surface stains from your teeth, giving them a brighter appearance. Many users have reported noticeable results after consistent use. 🌟✨It's also worth mentioning that the powder is made from natural ingredients, which is a big plus for those who prefer more organic options. 🌿🍃However, it's important to note that activated charcoal can be a bit messy to use, and it may temporarily stain your toothbrush or sink. So, be sure to rinse everything thoroughly after use. 💦Overall, if you're looking for a natural teeth whitening option, the Urban Botanics Activated Charcoal Teeth Whitening Powder could be worth a try. Just be prepared for the potential messiness. Let me know if you have any other questions! 😊🦷
good one
Its just a mouth freshener and cleaner gives soothing minty freshness for some time along with little cleaning to teeth but will not whiten the teeth.Also the powder is very messy , powder spill easily making blackness everywhere.If you have tartar build up consult a dentist to clean and whiten the teeth
This is very useful
I Have not seen any major difference after using this product, the product is also heavy marketed  using influencers and thus by improving rating and review of the product by paid  review or by giving product sample , this  is clearly visible in the well written reviews and feedbacks.

Pretty much impressed by the results. Taken the picture before and after my first use! Slight yet visible improvement in the teeth colour.Loved the freshness which stayed even after hours of brushing.Must try!!Will update the review after a week!UPDATE: after a couple of months I see no visible result. Downgrading from 5 to 2 stars. 2 stars for freshness.
I recently purchased the UrbanBotanics® Activated Charcoal Teeth Whitening Powder, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations. This enamel-safe teeth whitener is a game-changer when it comes to achieving a brighter smile.The first thing that caught my attention was the all-natural formulation. Being conscious of harsh chemicals, I appreciated that this product was made from activated charcoal and other natural ingredients. It gave me peace of mind knowing that I was using a safe and gentle product on my teeth.Using the powder was easy, and I noticed immediate results after just a few uses. The charcoal powder effectively lifted surface stains, leaving my teeth visibly whiter and brighter. It also helped with reducing plaque and freshening my breath, which was an added bonus.I was initially concerned about the potential mess that charcoal powder could cause, but the packaging and design of the product were excellent. The twist-open cap and tight seal ensured that there were no spills or messes while using the product.Another standout feature was the absence of any unpleasant taste or texture. The powder had a mild mint flavor that made the teeth whitening process much more enjoyable.Overall, the UrbanBotanics® Activated Charcoal Teeth Whitening Powder is a fantastic addition to my dental care routine. It's effective, safe, and easy to use, providing visible results without any harsh chemicals. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to achieve a radiant smile with a natural and enamel-safe solution.
Worth for money. Perfect tooth whitener. Just go for it.
It didn't make my teeth feel sensitive. It's safe for your enamel and gets rid of stains on your teeth. After using it a few times, I saw a big improvement in how white my smile was.

The serum is incredibly easy to apply
It gives real results

I recently tried the Perfora Teeth Whitening Pen, and I'm impressed with the results. The peroxide-free formula is gentle on enamel, making it a safe choice for teeth whitening. The gel's vanilla mint flavor is pleasant, providing a refreshing experience during application. I appreciate that it's vegan and effectively removes stains, leaving my teeth noticeably whiter.
It's been 2 weeks I'm using this product and I can see the changes...worth every penny highly recommended product!
Product not good . Disappointed
Uts very easy to use and helps to clear yellowish stains. You can use it anytime and anywhere.
So effective, I have used it only 3-4 times till now but I can see the results. Perfect game changer
got results after 1 week taste is also decent
I couldn't see much difference immediately after first application but yeah the difference was visible after few uses. Overall, a decent product.
Amazing experienceClean teeth 🦷
Superb quality. Product is really very good.I loved it.Must buy
                    The media could not be loaded.                 Use everyday after brushing tosnee results. Good product.
The product is good. But if you want to use it for long period, make sure you don't dip your wet toothbrush into the charcoal powder for it to come on your brush. Keep a separate small dry spoon for it and use it for shifting a part of powder into your brush, so as to avoid the powder to become like small powder balls due to coming to touch with water.
Helpful
One of the best things about the natural teeth whitening powder is that it doesn't contain any harmful chemicals. As someone who tries to prioritize natural and organic products, this was a big selling point for me. I appreciated that the powder was made from all-natural ingredients like activated charcoal and coconut oil, which are known for their teeth whitening properties. Plus, the powder is vegan-friendly and cruelty-free, which aligns with my values as well. Overall, I think the Habbits natural teeth whitening powder is a great alternative I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a safer and more natural option.
The fregnance is so overpowered.Easy to use but useless for short time period.
The product is just about the same as any other product with the addition of charcoal. It doesn't work as stated by the company. I have been using it for two months now and still no visible results. It has a very light peppermint taste.
I have been using it since 3 months now. Cant say if there’s diffence in colour of my teeth
Hands down best teeth whitening powder
After 2 weeks of use I can say the product is genuine and good.Used it 3-4 times a week with normal toothpasteMy teeth have become a shade lighterHope to get better results with time
It will take time to show results
I’ve using this powder regularly for almost 11 days now, the result is effective and very satisfying. My teeth have become a shade lighter and my gums feel refreshed.Thank you team habbits and congratulations for creating a wonderful product.
Used along with Perfora whitening toothpaste and felt effective and fresh after use. Good product.
I have been using this product for a while and have noticed a significant improvement in my tooth color… They have started turning from yellow to pale yellow.
The product is as good as described; I started using it within 3 days, and I've seen quite satisfactory results.
I didn't like it.
I’ve just purchased this awesome product and it has given me the instant resultFrom the past few years I’m trying different products for my teeth but now I’ve found the best one.Thankyou prefora for building my confidence again.
                    The media could not be loaded.                 This is worst as ever I used. Never buy even they are sending you free
Pretty good at this price. Need to use for few more days to see if the result is satisfactory or not!
It looks promising and waiting for the results to show as I just started using it.
Received my order 3 days backThe delivery was on time, package also looked and was received in good condition.I am using this product since the time I received. There is no specific charcoal taste but gives a hint of watermelon flavour. Since the time I have used it , it’s showing gradual whitening and it looks promising.
Haven’t used the product yet but i can say that the packaging is very nice it all smells like bubblegum in the box.. nice
After using the product getting results is very low and price to much costly.
Not work at all
Paisa kharab karna ho to kharido ye products

This is The Teeth Brightening Powder with 30grams of it in, which has PAP + HAp which gives instant At home teeth whitening Treatment, See Your results in only 7 years, I prefer to buy this excellent product right now....
I recently tried Daybreak whitening Powder, and I'm impressed with the results. Very effective and easy to use. makes teeth whiter and stain free after few applications... highly recommended, must buy.
People with yellow teeth must do it. It gives very good results after 7 days.
Not effective
The product claims to whiten teeth and remove stains in a week. However, I have been using the product for more than a week now and I cannot find any visible difference so far. So, as per me the product does not deliver what it promises.
exciting product with great results in a small period of time
The product works as intended. A good product for having white teeth
I really like the product it whiten my teeth from 1st days itself but after use it for 5day result can see by my family also.. works 100% recommend.
It does what it says, but if you’re expecting like those bright white teeth, you’re not going to get that it naturally gets your teeth white, which is your teeth, natural whiteness
I like this product. My theeth is sensitive but use full product.Thanku so much....
these products has been a game-changer. I've noticed a significant improvement in the whiteness of my teeth, and my breath feels consistently clean. The formulation seems to tackle plaque effectively, leaving my teeth with a smooth, polished feeling after each use.
I tried this for the very first timeSmell is quite good and the pen is also an great innovation, first impression is great will share more after few days
Product is good, the powder and the paste both are fantastic and helped me to whitening my teeth. I just know the use of the brush hence 3 stars
It visibly brightens my teeth in just 2 weeks of use. Going to recommend it to all my family members & friends. Also the mint aftertaste is just so refreshing. Love the scent . Worth buying 5/5
I use this product since 30 days after watch it in shark tank.... I orderd full package and then two pen... But no result... I don't know how many days I have to wait for result...
Good product smells and effective recommended your teeth are shine within 3 weeks and you wish to recommend others also
the reason why i gave 4 stars is because the whitening pen doesn’t work.the toothpaste and the powder do leave a refreshing feeling in your mouth and do show results overtime
tried , no effect seen .
Good product for regular use. Definitely makes a difference. But the pen may not be good for long term use.
Good product for teeth whitening , recommend for further .
It's one of the best teeth whitening products out there. I started noticing visible difference under 3 days of using it. A must use if you're looking forward to get pearly white teeth and confident smiles.
Results as promised. Peppermint flavor freshens the breathe which lasts a long time.
Whenever I used this toothpaste for the first time, I didn't think that this toothpaste would work, I got shocked because it turned out to be very good, I recommend this product to everyone.🤩🔥🔥❤️
Purple TeethWhiten Serum works wonders! Noticed a visible difference in just a few uses. A must-have for a brighter smile!
This teeth whitening serum is a game-changer! Within days, I noticed a remarkable difference in the brightness of my smile. The serum is easy to apply, and the results are stunning. No sensitivity issues, just a dazzling, confident grin. A fantastic product that delivers on its promise – worth every penny!
I bought the whitening strips and purple serum from their website, I didn't buy the pen because I think the pen and strip have the same ingredients so it doesn't make sense to order both. The purple serum promises to make teeth instantly white which to my surprise is true.It works on a yellow color effect, and instantly hides the yellowness from tones, so if you have yellowness on your teeth its great.I also had some stains on my teeth due to too much coffee I guess, so I bought strips from those. Well, Strips don't show the result instantly of course, but after some use your teeth do start to turn white. I also checked on how safe the ingredients are, and they are very safe as compared to traditional peroxide bleaching.The flavor for both is ok, not too much sugar, but they do what they promise. With strips, just be a little patient.
I recently tried Otanics teeth powder and was pleasantly surprised by the impressive results. As someone who's tried various teeth whitening products in the past, I can confidently say that this powder stands out for its effectiveness and ease of use.The first thing that caught my attention was the simplicity of the application process. The powder comes in a user-friendly container making it mess-free and easy to incorporate into my daily oral care routine. The fine powder has a pleasant minty flavor, leaving a refreshing taste after each use.What truly sets Otanics apart is the noticeable improvement in the whiteness of my teeth. After just a few days of regular use, I observed a significant difference in the brightness of my smile. The powder effectively removed surface stains, giving my teeth a natural and radiant appearance.I appreciate that Otanics Teeth Whitening Powder is formulated with ingredients that prioritize dental health. It doesn't cause sensitivity or discomfort, a common concern with some other whitening products. Instead, my teeth felt clean, and I experienced no adverse effects during the entire period of use.Furthermore, the compact packaging makes it travel-friendly, allowing me to maintain my oral care routine even when on the go. The results speak for themselves, and I'm confident in recommending Otanics Teeth Whitening Powder to anyone looking for an affordable and reliable solution for a brighter, whiter smile.
Nice product 👌👌
Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)I've been struggling with toothache and cavity problems for what felt like ages. This product is nothing short of a miracle for anyone dealing with dental issues. In this review, I'll share my experience with this teeth power and how it transformed my dental health.Ease of Use: ★★★★★ (5/5)One of the things that immediately impressed me about Otanics Advance+ Teeth Power was its ease of use. All I had to do was dip my toothbrush into this powder after applying toothpaste, and I was ready to brush as usual. The powder blends effortlessly with my toothpaste, creating a smooth and refreshing brushing experience. No complicated routines or extra steps required!Whitening: ★★★★★ (5/5)After using it consistently for a few days, I noticed a visible improvement in the whiteness of my teeth. It doesn't bleach or damage the enamel but gently removes stains, leaving my smile noticeably brighter.Cavity Protection: ★★★★★ (5/5)The real game-changer for me was the cavity protection this product offers. I used to be prone to cavities, and the dentist visits were constant. After incorporating Otanics Advance+ Teeth Power into my routine, I noticed a significant reduction in the development of new cavities. It creates a protective barrier on the teeth, making them more resilient to decay and cavities. It's like having a shield for my teeth!Toothache Reduction: ★★★★★ (5/5)Toothaches used to be a part of my daily life. This power changed that. I can't believe how effective it is in reducing toothache. Within just a few days of use, the discomfort I had been enduring for so long started to fade away. It's like a soothing balm for my teeth and gums.Taste and Sensation: ★★★★☆ (4/5)The only minor drawback I found was the taste, which is slightly unusual, but it didn't bother me much because the results are so worth it. The sensation is a little gritty at first, but it becomes smooth as you brush. It didn't take me long to get used to it, and the results far outweigh any initial discomfort.In conclusion, Otanics Advance+ Teeth Power is a dental game-changer. It helps with teeth whitening, provides effective cavity protection, and has miraculously reduced my toothaches. The ease of use and noticeable improvements make it an absolute must-have in my oral care routine.

Khatam product hai fhaltu paisa chala gya
Happy to get this
Amazing
It clean the teeth
I really love this product for over the time use it has really changed the colour of my teeths I have using this from last15 days, visible difference observed in teeth shade.This is a great product. It work amazingly for teeth whitening. Its pocket friendly and do what it says.
Been using teeth whitening combo for a week and so far been pleasantly surprised. Seeing some results. Lets see how it turns out to be after 2 weeks.
It will work if your teeth aren't having long time paleness but if someone has yellowness for along time it might not completely give you whitening
The formula is very harsh like you can use it but there will be a problem but with your salivary gland saliva produce is so much or saliva that automatically the the term of your mouth will remove it and then you will feel like okay let's give it a try and it will never be like many like many try it will be successfull you need  good amount of patients to do that I won't recommend this if you guys really want to try it send your wish your money to everything you want but if you don't want to waste your money don't buy this I think the purple toothpaste that everyone were showing a network in trend you should do that actually I haven't tried it but I know it would be better
There's a noticeable difference I saw after using these strips. My teeth became visibly whiter and stains started to fade within days. The promise of clinic like results at home is no exaggeration. Also I love the color theme they've chosen and the packaging is sleek and well-designed it matches the premium quality of the product.
The pen and strip combo is mind blowing, reduced the yellowness of my teeth. The pen is super handy and I carry it with me everywhere.
You need shiny teeth to go with a shiny personality like mine and I'm so happy I have something for it now. It really helps me get my shine on...😍🤓love it this product
Full of freshness and removes stains also... Good for traveling recommended to all....Go for itAmazing results
The product is very nice. It works amazingly. I just loved this teeth whitening pen. Quality is very good. Easy to use and long-lasting. Value for money.
Great packaging and amazing product, super easy to use and already starting to see results
It's one of the best teeth whitening products out there. I started noticing visible difference under 3 days of using it. A must use if you're looking forward to get pearly white teeth and confident smiles.
Results as promised. Peppermint flavor freshens the breathe which lasts a long time.
Whenever I used this toothpaste for the first time, I didn't think that this toothpaste would work, I got shocked because it turned out to be very good, I recommend this product to everyone.🤩🔥🔥❤️
Purple TeethWhiten Serum works wonders! Noticed a visible difference in just a few uses. A must-have for a brighter smile!
This teeth whitening serum is a game-changer! Within days, I noticed a remarkable difference in the brightness of my smile. The serum is easy to apply, and the results are stunning. No sensitivity issues, just a dazzling, confident grin. A fantastic product that delivers on its promise – worth every penny!
I bought the whitening strips and purple serum from their website, I didn't buy the pen because I think the pen and strip have the same ingredients so it doesn't make sense to order both. The purple serum promises to make teeth instantly white which to my surprise is true.It works on a yellow color effect, and instantly hides the yellowness from tones, so if you have yellowness on your teeth its great.I also had some stains on my teeth due to too much coffee I guess, so I bought strips from those. Well, Strips don't show the result instantly of course, but after some use your teeth do start to turn white. I also checked on how safe the ingredients are, and they are very safe as compared to traditional peroxide bleaching.The flavor for both is ok, not too much sugar, but they do what they promise. With strips, just be a little patient.
First time I am using it and result can be seen
Good product...stains are removed after prolonged use...recommended
No result ..
➡ I am a big tea lover so staining is a big issue for me & this is the only reason which forced me to buy this product.➡ I was skeptical to try this, not going to lie. But even after the first use I noticed a difference.➡ There are some directions, on the back, so I'm not sure why I saw reviews saying otherwise unless thats newly added.➡ My teeth do seem whiter.... Stupid me didn't take before pictures to compare. But more than that, they feel more cleaner. So its definitely doing something right.➡ There was practically no flavor... Not exactly sure what kind of flavor I was expecting, but there was nothing, which is a bit odd. In the future, if they add a flavoring, I'll be the first to order.➡ I like that the ingredients are all natural. Use care to keep the open jar out of any breeze, the powder seems to expand once it gets loose!➡ Overall I have been very pleased with this product! Thank you for creating a product that is natural, pain free, and affordably whitens my teeth!➡ I take my personal product reviews seriously, and if something proves to be a piece of junk, I'll tell you - and if it's great or mediocre, I'll tell you that, too. My policy is to try to write the kind of reviews I want to read and to update my reviews if for some reason the product fails to perform as advertised during the period it's warrantied for.

Plz don't buy this charcoal powder aapke paise kharab hoge
The product that I received came with nice packaging but the product itself is a second hand product. The product seems to be a used product. Comes with seal but don't know how the charcoal dust came off as soon as I open the lid of the bottle. After, verifying closely I observed the seal was placed neatly with a glue which any user's will not come to notice. Unless, he/she verify the product under a bright light.Now, After removing the adhesive and the seal I found the charcoal dust which is why we are buying this has only 1/4 of the total quantity. Even the wrapper around the bottle looks messy with lots of folds and one can completely see that the product is used before.I don't know what is going on? But I can see there's no option to return the product to get a replacement. Nice trick made by the seller. Well, talking about the product I didn't find any MINT in it. I have used it for day with multiple times but can't seems to find any thing good with it.But I have to wait and see if it works really after using it for 10 days at a stretch. Even I came across some review that says the product received is of less quantity and that's what made me feel suspicious about the intention of the seller. Well, I am not disappointed with the purchase, let's see if it really works then I don't have complaints regarding the product but the seller is a mischievous character. I can't do much about it instead writing about it. So I'll update the review later if the product comes out to be really value for money. Until then, keep smiling.
I came across this activated charcoal powder for teeth whitening on Amazon, and decided to give it a shot. After trying it out for myself, I can say it's pretty good product.Initially, I thought to Be Just another normal charcoal powder which would be a pain to get off of the tooth brush. But turns out, there is some kind of truth to this whole activated charcoal thing. The Powder was very fine, and is easy to apply on the toothbrush when it is slightly wet.According to the instructions given on the container, we just have to get the toothbrush and appeared in the charcoal powder. After it has been covered with the charcoal powder, you just brush your teeth for about 2 minutes with this and then wash it off. I did so, and did not notice much of a difference in the first try. Maybe takes more than one attempts. Let's see.It also claims to strengthen the gums and fight plaque, which is a good sign. Anal tomorrow I think his affair product for you to try out you are curious to know how activated charcoal powder affects your teeth. This 20 gram pack is a good starter, so go ahead and get it if you feel like you need to try it. You certainly won't lose anything.
Just bought it few days bk and have used only once... Felt good..but will cm to know about the results after few uses only.
It is good but it can be made a bit softer..not for the sensitive teeth..for whitening-yes it does it’s job
HealthVit Activated Charcoal Powder for Natural Teeth Whitening- 20gm.Our ancestors were using coal and Babul stem as teeth cleansing agent, and now with the advance science and technology, it is even better than ever.FACTS-👉 Charcoal is made from coal, wood, or other substances.👉  It is activated when treated with high temperature (oxidized), which makes it more porous. This gives it the power to trap toxins and chemicals.BENEFITS -  😀👉 Fresh mouth and fresher breath.👉 Polishes teeth enamel for whiter teeth.👉 Cleanse teeth, gum and destroy plaque.👉 Fight cavity and tooth decay.👉 Detoxify mouth.👉 Remove stains caused by tea, coffee or tobacco.ADVANTAGES- 😎It is free from any harmful substances-  👉 no harmful chemicals, fluoride or bleach.  👉 Natural & pure.  👉 Safe for everyday use.  👉 fine powder causes less abrasion.TASTE & ODOUR- 😀No taste or odor at all, though it contains Pudina leaf and Babul stem extracts.BOTTLE-👍Comes in a matte black pet bottle. The bottle I receive has a 3D hologram on the cap. Had this hologram a bit lower on the edge of the cap and body of the bottle, it would have provided a better protection and assurance that it was not opened.Upon opening the bottle, there is a tin foil that is supposed to be pasted on the mouth of the bottle. But mine was just lying there and it came out as soon as I opened the cap. The powder was spilled all over because of this.  😶DISPENSING- 🤔A small amount of powder is enough for one time use.I wish there was a dispensing cap, this can save a lot of time and wastage of the powder.USE- 💡I sprinkle a pinch of the activated charcoal over a pea sized toothpaste on my brush.Using it on alternate days.The result is nice so far. Not seeing a very drastic change in teeth color, but I can feel the freshness. No mouth odor.I am sure that long-term use will improve the color of my teeth. 😁Taking down 1 star because of the unsealed bottle, otherwise, the product is up to the mark. 👍I hope the review helps. 😀
This is The Teeth Brightening Powder with 30grams of it in, which has PAP + HAp which gives instant At home teeth whitening Treatment, See Your results in only 7 years, I prefer to buy this excellent product right now....
I recently tried Daybreak whitening Powder, and I'm impressed with the results. Very effective and easy to use. makes teeth whiter and stain free after few applications... highly recommended, must buy.
People with yellow teeth must do it. It gives very good results after 7 days.
Not effective
The product claims to whiten teeth and remove stains in a week. However, I have been using the product for more than a week now and I cannot find any visible difference so far. So, as per me the product does not deliver what it promises.
exciting product with great results in a small period of time
The product works as intended. A good product for having white teeth
I really like the product it whiten my teeth from 1st days itself but after use it for 5day result can see by my family also.. works 100% recommend.
It does what it says, but if you’re expecting like those bright white teeth, you’re not going to get that it naturally gets your teeth white, which is your teeth, natural whiteness
I like this product. My theeth is sensitive but use full product.Thanku so much....

Just got delivered today! I am excited to use it for myself see the very first result as i am a coffee drinker. Will update in a while with before and after pictures of the very first test round.Update couple hours later at night , so i was done eating dinner and as instructed in the manual after teeth whiting dont eat anything for an hr .1) read manual (dont brush teeth before)2) open the strips packet (2 strips)3) apply lower one first then top4) there was no indication (atleast i couldn't find it)Which strip show go up or down / long strip or short strip . So i went with instinct  used the longer for top and shorter for bottom5) carefully peel the strip from the packaging and careful they r sticky so they roll up at then end like tape and stick together. So plz be careful so u dont waste strips.  Apply on6) once u have changed the uv device and cleaned with hot water to sanitiser (not boiling) place it in ur mouth with the power button facing upwards.7) first round 30mins, i kept for 20 i ran out of patience hehehe (it has a self timer but u also much check ur watch)8) during this process this will make u drool alot ( accumulation of saliva in ur mouth) go spit it out.9) once done peel the tape from ur teeth and throw in the dustbin.....gargle and wash ur mouth properly and if u feel sickness lightly brush ur teeth and wash ur mouth.10) all clean teeth .... good for a week
                    The media could not be loaded.                 It is very effective & usefull product.easy to use.it comes with 14 pcs  whitening strips.24 blue led light remove deep stains from the tooth.easy to carry...& make s gorgious smile..
                    The media could not be loaded.                 I have tried for the first time and I have measured my teeth color with the card first then after few usage I have seen the difference.
Initially i used it for 10 mins once per day, there was little to no change for 2 days then i started using it for 30 mins once per day. And it did whiten my teeth upto 2 shades in a week. Sometimes my teeth would look 2 shade whitened sometimes they'd look 3 and sometimes there were no change at all. And it would look like they used to. Then i googled how often should i use whitening strips which said twice a day, only then i started noticing significant change upto 7 shades in 2-3 weeks. I have sensitive teeth but this didn't trigger my sensitivity at all even after 30 mins. Must be because process is slow but it does work.P.s. they should tell us what percentage of hydrogen peroxide is present in the strips so we can judge better.
Good for your health teeth 😊
How can be this kind of products are available in Amazon. It doesn't work as claimed. It has liquid gel which only freshens your breath doesn't work in whitening of your teeth. Take my genuine suggestions don't waste your money buying this useless product. 10 rupees toothpaste is better than this. I would have given 0 stars if it is there.
Good
I really like how convenient It is to use. It gives a very natural finish to your teeth. Also, it works as a mouth freshner which is really great.
Just tried this teeth whitening pen from protouch and I'm OBSESSED!  I've been using it for a few weeks now, and I'm absolutely loving the results. It's easy to use and has definitely helped me achieve a brighter, whiter smile. This little gem is a game changer, providing noticeable results in no time. It's compact, easy to use, and perfect for on-the-go touch-ups. If you're looking for a quick and effective way to enhance your smile, look no further!
I have used this product for a week or 10 days and didn't see any dynamic difference as mentioned in the other reviews with the first usage itself. Plus it very inconvenient to use. One has to keep on clicking the button given on the other side for the help to come out and since the gel is less in quantity, so by this rapid clicking chances are there that it may fall into your basin. Although I am thinking of giving it another shot to see the so called effective results mentioned in the other reviews. But so far I have not came cross this whitening result after first usage itself. Further, the freshness thing after usage was because of mint or menthol type ingredient which I didn't felt from second or third usage onwards. This might be helpful with your purchase for this item.
Worst product u can ever useDon’t purchase this
It was superb and gave me results with २ weeks
This pen made my teeth clear or I can say white after using it for some time, I can say that it's a good product. I can smile with confident! Thanks seller for a fine product.
This pen made my teeth clear. i have been using this for sometime now and it really does work.
This teeth whitening charcoal powder is an absoulute must use Since it contains all the essential ingredients that help cleanse and whitens the teeth from naturally from deep within and gives them a  very shinny after effects. It also keep my teeth healthy and strengthens them . It has a very strong flavour and fragrance of peppermint.Its very easy to use and must be used in the morning to get effective results. I have used it 6-7 times till now result awesome😊😍
Good
So I’ve been using it for 6 months or more and has been very effective in whitening the teeth within a week or so but personally I feel the product is not safe for gums as it feels normal in the starting but after a long term use, it starts creating minor discomfort in gums and starts weakening them(I’m not sure about the weakening part as it could be just me) but based on my purchase, I’d recommend to use with caution. Otherwise, overall a great product.
I barely used it once and did not feel any spearmint flavour or taste in my mouth.The next time I opened the plastic jar, it had a weird, ghostly white, gossamer cobweb, all over the charcoal powder. I had to dump it in trash. Money wasted...total bummer!
I am using this charcoal powder from last few daysAnd I am in love with this product 😍😍😍Being  a tea and coffee lover I was facing yellow teeth problem.After  first use I can notice a huge difference.This product whiten and brighten my teethWith out leaving any side effect.The flavor is awesome and 😇This product is 100%organic☺☺So you can trust it blindly
Though it claims for instant whitening, it doesnt rly help in that. The mint flavor is very strong and peels off the lips skin if you brush your teeth for more than 30 seconds.Gives freshness of breath but thts not wot I got it for. Disappointed!
The most important thing that I would like to highlight is that the product is organic, charcoal is already known for deep cleanse properties, and it has got the flavor of spearmint which makes it more delightful to use.Just dampen your brush and dive into the powder. It is a good way to switch to natural products. You must give it a try.
Used this product and was really Good .
This, totally, is a rescue. There's this paleness prevailing on my teeth, a month ever since I scaled my teeth. No toothpaste, even the ones with salt and charcoal content, could be of help. That's when my doctor prescribed me to give a last try to this and I can't tell you how enthusiastic I am to share the message that it actually works. I mean, it's just 5 days - 10 uses to be precise, counting as 2 uses per day, the results are prominently seen.
It really whitens your teeth. Not sure if the product is healthy as any burnt thing when ingested is a potential carcinogen. So is charcoal. But the product works. Make sure to not ingest it. Also the powder is filled to the brim. Be careful while opening the first time, it may spill over. Good but maybe not safe product for your teeth!!! My teeth are much whiter after using for a week daily once!!!
Daybreak is definitely one of best brands for dental care! I use their electric toothbrush and was intrigued to use their other products. The teeth whitening strips comes in package of 28 strips for 14 treatments. I’ve started using it and have started seeing minor difference. You can try this if you’re looking for teeth whitening products in the market.
The best product i used till yet for teeth whitening, amazed
not that effective as hydrogen peroxide whitening strips but works quite well
This product makes high quality teeth whitening accessible to everyone. This products have teeth strip pouches individually packed for each usage. One pouch contains two strips for upper and lower teeth. You just need to insure that your teeth are clean and dry and then stick the strips. Wait for 30 minutes and then remove the strips. The teeth will be somewhat noticeably whiter with each usage. Do this two times daily and then see the results. The quality of the product is very good. Daybreak is now my favorite dental brand. I usage it's toothbrush, toothpaste and teeth whitening solutions. I have also used the pen whitening solution.Go for it. I will also make sure to update this review after my long term review.
It might be helpful only if strips stick on teeth. It is difficult to stick them on teeth due to saliva in mouth.
Hard to apply & not for big teeth
it is easy to use but you have to be consistent as it is written on the box that you have to do this twice in a day then you can see the improvement otherwise not
The product is just miracle, its a boon for all the user who are having red or yellow teeth due to some bad eating habits.Its enamle free as well as its cruelty and peroxide free.The packaging is also nice, and the gum used to stick to your teet is also of good quality.The usage is also like 3 year old child can also use this.
Strips smell good ..we only used one strip so far but the quality  of adhesive is bad .it comes off and it's not convenient
It was my first time in trying any dental beauty products. I was sceptical at first but was excited to try this thing out. It’s been more than a week and it’s very easy to fit into my routine. I’m seeing effects for sure and I love the minty breath it leaves me with. One thing, I’d request the makers is - to give customers like a continuity plan. What do we do after the 2-3 weeks? I’d love to get a subscription if there’s a plan in place :))))) actually, :D
Very useful product
quality is nice. whitens teeth as per need
Value for money
It's a very nice deal, I love the product. Quality is superb. Hurry I highly recommend to consider this product.
Whitening pen works wonders but the protouch device was hard to use and didn't give great benefits
There is no change. Nothing is worth it
                    The media could not be loaded.                 Merchant is selling more than the mrp which is 2500 on the box..it been 15 days I am using it but nothing has happened yet..such a waste of money..pathetic product…
Product is really very useful & effective. Teeth whitening claims and its truly superb.Must buy and use it.
Nice
This product is such a waste of money, this can never replace your traditional toothbrush. Please do not even give a try unless you have a lot of money to waste on such a useless product.
Nice cream and very thick, easy to use. It’s worth giving a try.Good product on reasonable price. One can give it a try.
Waste of money… you can get 100 times better results for same money at a professional dentist. Better safe than sorry.
This device is excellent at removing tartar.
I've used it once. Did a good job of cleaning my teeth. Just need to learn how to use it. Takes sometimes since it's not that powerful, like the once you get at a dentist. But at this price, this is much better. Even if I use it every 3 months, I can easily receiver the cost of this machine. Plaque removal is 400 to 500 if you visit a dentist. This can save money. Takes time and patience. Just need to use it properly or you can damage the enamel. Overall good product. Now I doubt the ones who are giving bad reviews.
I was facing teeth stain issue and it's a really good product. You can save your money and dentist visit time.
Amazing quality and packaging. Very premium feel. Ultrasonic vibrations are good and strong easily descaled my teeth. Description provided is accurate.Highly recommended.
This will help you remove hard stains from cofee or ciggerates .. It won't make your teeth completely white but will remove the darker stains completely
As a heavy smoker i had to visit the dentist quite often, now this little thing is working very great, i guess i had to make less appointment to the dentist. This little thing works very great, i dont regret that i choose this thing over the one which has many attachments like the toothbrush and other thing. This product do exactly what it needs to do, it can remove a tar buildup in my teeth, wow, lets hope it can last long even if not its very cheap 1/6th of a dentist visit. I will definitely buy again.
Absolutely worth buying it
It is not working. Build and finishing of the product is great but it is not working. As there is no return and no warranty, I guess you will have to take chance when you order it, which I did and lost my money.
Does not clean teeth at all
the product is worth to buy
Very very bad quality, dont work

इस चारकोल को यूज करने के बाद मेरे दांतो की इनेमल बहुत ज्यादा खराब हो गई अब मैं पिछले कई महीनों से डॉक्टर का ट्रीटमेंट ले रहा हूं यह बहुत ही खतरनाक प्रोडक्ट है आप लोग इससे बहुत ही सावधान रहें और ऐसे प्रोडक्ट बिल्कुल ना खरीदें मैं खरीद कर इसे बहुत पछता रहा हूं
My teeth had turned yellow due to neglect. Tried this product for the first time and within one use my teeth were brighter! Within one use! It is hard to find products that show results within first use so I am overjoyed.Using the product is a little messy. It stains hands and sink. I have experience with using charcoal to brush teeth when I was a kid so the mess was as expected for me. For folks who don't know, it is very messy. Would suggest using this first and then brushing teeth with your normal toothpaste. Also, best to use it right before taking bath so that the stain washes away from your arms.
It was look like old peice and also broken.
Ok .not bad.. i have a yellow teeth... Not that useful but it clean nicely.. thats it... Dont expect whiteness... Ita just okk...Anything or whatever other brand u order
Received the product spilled over the container
Pros -1) really does the jobCons -It will make you feel you just played holi with black colourIt will not remove all the yellow patches.But you'll get the shine on front face of teethWhile brushing stay away from mirror or basin if you don't want to make it dirty..And to wash it you'll need brush cause patches will be stubborn in nature.For electronic brushesh perfect product..For Normal brushes you'll struggle !!
