Fresh and healthy.
I really don't know whether it repairs the teeth or not, but overall experience is good. Only negative point I would like to mention that it's excessively highly priced considering the quantity.
The primary reason I started using Sensodyne was to address my tooth sensitivity. I'm thrilled to say that it has worked wonders. Within a few weeks of regular use, I noticed a significant reduction in tooth sensitivity. I can now enjoy hot and cold beverages without cringing in pain. It also provides excellent cavity protection and leaves my teeth feeling clean and fresh.Sensodyne is incredibly gentle on the teeth and gums. It doesn't have the abrasive texture that some other toothpaste brands do, which can be harsh on enamel. Instead, it provides a soothing and calming effect on my teeth, making brushing a comfortable experience.The flavor of Sensodyne toothpaste is mild and pleasant, with a hint of mintiness. It doesn't overpower your mouth but leaves a fresh feeling after brushing. While I appreciate the subtlety, a variety of flavors to choose from would be a nice addition for those who prefer different tastes.
Good for dental repair
Packing was good. Working good for sensitive tooth pain
Sensodyne Repair & Protect - 100g | Toothpaste for deep repair of sensitive teethI've been using Sensodyne Repair & Protect toothpaste for about a month now, and I'm really happy with the results. I have sensitive teeth, and I used to get a lot of pain when I ate cold or hot foods. But since I started using this toothpaste, my sensitivity has decreased significantly. I still get a twinge of pain sometimes, but it's much less than it used to be.I also like that this toothpaste helps to whiten my teeth. I've noticed that my teeth look a bit brighter since I started using it.The only downside to this toothpaste is that it doesn't have a very strong minty flavor. I prefer toothpastes with a stronger mint flavor, but this one is still okay.Overall, I'm very happy with Sensodyne Repair & Protect toothpaste. It's helped to reduce my tooth sensitivity and whiten my teeth. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a toothpaste for sensitive teeth.Pros:* Reduces tooth sensitivity* Whitens teeth* Fluoride-freeCons* Mint flavor is not very strong**Overall:**A great toothpaste for sensitive teeth. It's effective at reducing sensitivity and whitening teeth. The mint flavor is not very strong, but it's still a good toothpaste overall. I would definitely recommend it.
The sensodyne toothpaste has many varients. Please see before selecting, all are not good. Sensodyne Total Care is capable of curing tooth aches and also works on sensitivity issue just like they show in their adds on TV but lacs in mouth freshness. After 2-3 days consecutive use, you may feel like haven't brushed your teeth properly. So I suggest if you have tooth ache or tooth sensitivity problem, go for it but keep another toothpaste of your choise alongside for mouth freshness and use them both alternatively every 2-3 days or if you brush your teeth both the times i.e. morning- night then you may use sensodyne in night and some other one in morning.
I have been using this product for the last 4 years. It's serving my dental requirements quite well.It's a bit costly.

1) Effect on teeth: It claims to solve many teeth problems, maybe there is effect but I didnt notice any.2) Sensitivity: Maybe not great for sensitive teeth. But not too bad.3) Taste: Tastes like some ayurvedic recipe. Not bad.4) Ingredients: Has many natural ingredients and minimal chemicals compared to other pastes.5) Price: The 3+1 combos are so much cheaper than the single ones. There are 100g, 150g, 200g variants in 3+1 combos, so check whichever you can afford and whichever is on biggger discount.Overall: Holygrail toothpaste. Would repurchase till I find a better cheaper alternative.

I absolutely love Himalaya Complete Care Toothpaste! This toothpaste is a game-changer for anyone looking for a natural alternative to traditional toothpaste. It has a refreshing taste that leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh all day long. I also appreciate that it's made with natural ingredients like neem and pomegranate, which have been shown to be effective in promoting healthy teeth and gums. Since using this toothpaste, I've noticed a significant improvement in the overall health of my teeth and gums. It's gentle yet effective, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality toothpaste that delivers real results. Plus, the fact that it's cruelty-free and eco-friendly makes it even better! Overall, I couldn't be happier with Himalaya Complete Care Toothpaste and will continue to use it for years to come.

This charcoal toothpaste is very useful for improving teeth and reducing cavities. It enhances freshness also
Nice
Charcoal toothpaste left me impressed with its teeth-whitening results. After consistent use, I noticed a subtle but definite brightening effect. The paste's texture is smooth, and it provides a refreshing feel during brushing. However, it's important to be cautious as the dark color can be messy and stain, requiring extra attention to bathroom surfaces. While the taste may not be everyone's favorite, the overall whitening benefits make it a viable option for those seeking a natural approach to a brighter smile.
I received this product but one pack was broken from which the paste comes out which feels unhygienic
Very nice toothpaste

I have been using Dabur Red Gel Ayurvedic Toothpaste for a few months now and I am very happy with the results. It is a natural toothpaste that contains 11 potent herbs that are known to have benefits for oral health. It helps to reduce bad breath, plaque, gingivitis, toothache, yellow teeth, cavity and gum bleeding. It also gives a refreshing feeling after brushing and makes my teeth look brighter and healthier.The toothpaste has a gel-like consistency and a pleasant herbal flavour.  The toothpaste comes in a convenient tube that is easy to squeeze and store. The pack of 300g lasts for a long time and is very economical.I would recommend Dabur Red Gel Ayurvedic Toothpaste to anyone who is looking for a natural and effective toothpaste

Of all the toothpaste brands that I have used so far, this is the one that both my wife and I have unanimously agreed to be the best.It must be understood that as a consumer, you cannot objectively see the change in the whitening levels of your teeth, or how long does the toothpaste's "freshness" last etc. However, the smell along with the flavor definitely makes us feel "fresh" compared to the boring white counterparts, or the so-called Ayurvedic toothpastes that just taste so bad!The choice of the toothpaste is a personal choice. However, we feel brushing at least twice every day, and combining it with a good mouthwash like Listerine does make us feel "clean" and "fresh"
Good gel toothpaste with crystals.. nice cooling effect.

The product reached in daged state. The smell is also bad
This is perfect tongue cleaner with goodness of copper. This is so much sturdier and better than the plastic tongue cleaners. Definitely recommend.
Just purchased the Perfora serum. Packaging is minimal and compact, to the point. Will share a detailed feedback after using the product.
I recently tried the Perfora Teeth Serum and it has completely transformed my oral care routine.
I am using this serum and I found real benefits
This is not worth the price it is not a toothpaste that we can use two times a day it is a colour corrector serum. Colour corrector is supposed to work instantly, and serums doesn‚Äôt need to be used on TEETH twice daily. The above photos is the before and after before being the photo on top and after on bottom it shows no difference whatsoever. And if i use it twice daily it would be finished in less than a week.The only thing good about it is the smell and it also leaves a sensitivity in your teeth.Very bad product i regret it I thought it was actually colour corrector but it is just a purple non cleaning mouth freshener nothing else!And fyi i tried it twice first time i did it like we use a toothpaste brushed for 2 minutes and second time I applied it and left it on for 5 minutes then spit it out didn‚Äôt even rinse my mouth thoroughly so that it doesn‚Äôt rinse off snd it doesn‚Äôt show any results.Don‚Äôt buy this rather go to a dentist and get teeth whitening done if ur that rich because neither does this cleans ur teeth nor does it whitens them it just leaves a freshened smell which can be achieved by mouth fresheners and a cold sensitivity .
It works as it says
This is really a good product.
I used n result was impressive but after sometime I have a sharp sensitivity with pain in teeth. May be it's side effects to me. So, I would recommend this quality product surely but consult with doctor also once if u have any sensitivity issue or even not.
Im using lavendar for past one month and really liked the product especially the energising and refreshing flavour it's leaves in your mouth, for teeth whitening you need to be patient as it's a long term process. The lemon flavour is one of my favourite and gets me fresh in the morning
If you are looking for teeth whitening product then this one is must try... It will give you visible results. Try it.
Good one works well
Working as expected.Quick relief
Bought for my dad about his tooth sensitivity. After one day use, the pain was gone. That means it really works. Thanks to Sensodyneüëç

Product looks promising.  Liked the minty freshness and the fact that natural ingredients are used in the composition. Will purchase again.
Amazing Product. Just go for it. You might feel the product cost is at the higher side but its worth the money.
I came across an article on the benefits of nano hydroxyapatite. Alot of new toothpaste brands claim to have nano hydorxyapetite (though they dont mention the %, this brand however does). I ordered a few online to test them out and compare. I found tis brand to be best amongst the others. Besides the nano hyroxyapetite this toothpaste has natural ingredients which was another plus point. Happy with the results so far. Mouth feels fresh and teeth and gum health has improved significantly.
Very Good product.

very good foaming great flavour
I am totally satisfied with the product.  The promise was fulfilled in full by the vendor and the manufacturer of the product.  About to repeat my order for this product.
I have been using Pepsodent for the longest time and never thought I would switch to any other toothpaste until I discovered Fang, which was suggested to me by my brother in law who was visiting me. Man o man! This toothpaste has changed my life and converted me from Pepsodent to Fang. I strongly recommend this toothpaste to everyone to see¬†the¬†difference.
very nice
Long lasting freshness
Fairly good
Good
Go for the one with crystals, leaves the breath lot more fresh
A toothpaste that is black in colour is definitely unusual but the paste should do the job that it‚Äôs supposed to do. I quite like the flavour although it‚Äôs mild. However, the mint flavour could have been enhanced. I have noticed the  frequent increase in price of this toothpaste variant . Well, this strategy might pay off in the short run , I doubt if the demand trend will remain forever.  Colgate should look into their Pricing Strategy.
Great pack for the money
I really love the product
Good in teeth cleaning however seems not different then other variant . Not sure why to spend more on this
I don't know how much of claimed charcoal is present but it's just another normal toothpaste.

So it tastes sort of bitter and spicy. Not complaining about it considering its ingredients but just a sort of disclaimer.I bought it because the offer is really good. You get a lot of toothpaste in an affordable price.The spicy aftertaste kind of makes the mouth feel slightly numb but the results more than make up for it, at least for me.
Excellent product...

This toothpaste effortlessly blends natural teeth-whitening agents with a fluoride-free, SLS-free formula.The after-brush feel is invigorating, thanks to the refreshing minty sensation that lingers. This, combined with the absence of harsh chemicals, makes it a winning choice for a daily oral care routine that's both effective and enjoyable. In summary, if you're seeking a toothpaste that not only enhances your smile but also aligns with your eco-conscious values, Perfora is the radiant choice.
I recently tried Perfora toothpaste, and I'm extremely satisfied with the results! This toothpaste not only left my mouth feeling incredibly fresh, but it also noticeably whitened my teeth after just a few uses. The minty flavor is pleasant without being overpowering, and it gives me long-lasting breath confidence throughout the day. I appreciate that it doesn't contains SLS. Overall,Perfora is now my go-to toothpaste, and I highly recommend it for a healthy and bright smile!
a really great alternative to toothpastes out there. might be a little expensive but it‚Äôs worth it. just loved it effect on oral hygiene, and keeps your mouth fresh. great product highly recommend.
I recently came across an exceptional toothpaste that is free of Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) and provides an unparalleled refreshing sensation that no other brand can match. I am thrilled to recommend this toothpaste to anyone seeking a superior dental experience.
It doesn‚Äôt give fresh breath for 24 hours as it claims. Maybe I need to try other products that they offer.
The toothpaste is nice, i have used colgate whitening toothpaste. That taste like full of chemicals.Here, it feels like chemical but not harsh.Need to improve the plastic quality of tube.
I like it‚Äôs fresh mint smell it also fell fresh when you use it and it‚Äôs really whiten my teeth.
This one is creating more saliva while brushing otherwise its all good very mild and long lasting freshness üëç

Fabulous product but i just use 2weeks i didn't see any minor differences let's see in future
Taste is ideal. Performance is satisfactory
I have been using from one year. It's very good product.

It tastes like dabur lal dant manjan. If you like that then this paste got that to T. Earlier taste was better. New one is just dabur powder in paste form.

Really good. Using it for sometime. Offering price by Amazon outstanding. Thanks
Paste is awesome but price is more. Last year this was 285/- 4 *200gm pack
I use this product.
Fresh and healthy.
I really don't know whether it repairs the teeth or not, but overall experience is good. Only negative point I would like to mention that it's excessively highly priced considering the quantity.
The primary reason I started using Sensodyne was to address my tooth sensitivity. I'm thrilled to say that it has worked wonders. Within a few weeks of regular use, I noticed a significant reduction in tooth sensitivity. I can now enjoy hot and cold beverages without cringing in pain. It also provides excellent cavity protection and leaves my teeth feeling clean and fresh.Sensodyne is incredibly gentle on the teeth and gums. It doesn't have the abrasive texture that some other toothpaste brands do, which can be harsh on enamel. Instead, it provides a soothing and calming effect on my teeth, making brushing a comfortable experience.The flavor of Sensodyne toothpaste is mild and pleasant, with a hint of mintiness. It doesn't overpower your mouth but leaves a fresh feeling after brushing. While I appreciate the subtlety, a variety of flavors to choose from would be a nice addition for those who prefer different tastes.
Good for dental repair
Packing was good. Working good for sensitive tooth pain
Sensodyne Repair & Protect - 100g | Toothpaste for deep repair of sensitive teethI've been using Sensodyne Repair & Protect toothpaste for about a month now, and I'm really happy with the results. I have sensitive teeth, and I used to get a lot of pain when I ate cold or hot foods. But since I started using this toothpaste, my sensitivity has decreased significantly. I still get a twinge of pain sometimes, but it's much less than it used to be.I also like that this toothpaste helps to whiten my teeth. I've noticed that my teeth look a bit brighter since I started using it.The only downside to this toothpaste is that it doesn't have a very strong minty flavor. I prefer toothpastes with a stronger mint flavor, but this one is still okay.Overall, I'm very happy with Sensodyne Repair & Protect toothpaste. It's helped to reduce my tooth sensitivity and whiten my teeth. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a toothpaste for sensitive teeth.Pros:* Reduces tooth sensitivity* Whitens teeth* Fluoride-freeCons* Mint flavor is not very strong**Overall:**A great toothpaste for sensitive teeth. It's effective at reducing sensitivity and whitening teeth. The mint flavor is not very strong, but it's still a good toothpaste overall. I would definitely recommend it.
The sensodyne toothpaste has many varients. Please see before selecting, all are not good. Sensodyne Total Care is capable of curing tooth aches and also works on sensitivity issue just like they show in their adds on TV but lacs in mouth freshness. After 2-3 days consecutive use, you may feel like haven't brushed your teeth properly. So I suggest if you have tooth ache or tooth sensitivity problem, go for it but keep another toothpaste of your choise alongside for mouth freshness and use them both alternatively every 2-3 days or if you brush your teeth both the times i.e. morning- night then you may use sensodyne in night and some other one in morning.
I have been using this product for the last 4 years. It's serving my dental requirements quite well.It's a bit costly.

Tastes good and refreshing new flavour
It is a very good product way better than the other products available in the market

Dark violet top with glittery colorful white base.. but they failed with the taste. Not bad. But not a good start for a day.

It's a dried up stuff in the tube. Tastes like rotten gel. And leaves dryness post use.

Effect on teeth
Netter than normal one
I have been using it for a long, and it has a good and reasonable effect/freshness on the teeth.
We like the taste and it works perfect for freshness
Very good
Nice product
I recently tried this toothpaste, and I'm impressed with the overall experience. The minty flavor provides a refreshing burst that leaves my mouth feeling clean and revitalized. The texture is smooth, and it foams up nicely, ensuring a thorough clean with each brush. I've noticed an improvement in my oral hygiene since using this toothpaste, with a reduction in plaque and a noticeable freshness that lasts throughout the day. Additionally, the packaging is convenient and easy to use. Overall, I highly recommend this toothpaste for its effectiveness in maintaining a healthy and clean smile.
It‚Äôs good and fresh feel. They says it‚Äôs without chemicals . But the fresh feel doesn‚Äôt last for 12 hrs . The color of the tooth paste is black . It can be white or transparent to give a better feel . It‚Äôs my opinion . We are used to white tooth pastes .
I recently had the pleasure of trying this toothpaste by Perfora, and I must say, it has truly transformed my brushing experience. From the first squeeze to the final rinse, this toothpaste delivers a refreshing burst of flavor that leaves my mouth feeling invigorated.One of the standout features that captured my attention is the impeccable freshness it provides. What further sets this toothpaste apart is the clean and crisp sensation it imparts to my teeth after each brushing session. It goes beyond just cleaning ‚Äì it leaves my teeth feeling polished and revitalized.Moreover, I'm particularly impressed by the commitment to using natural ingredients. The absence of artificial sweeteners is a game-changer, ensuring a pure and genuine taste without any unnecessary additives. This toothpaste is also free of SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate), showcasing a dedication to oral health without compromising on quality.
                    The media could not be loaded.                ¬†I found the description of the product to be different and wanted to try the product. But I was pleasantly surprised. The fragrance is wonderful and the taste is extraordinary. I have been using this product for more than a week and no complaints so far. Bought another toothpaste of the same brand too.
As you can see the silver cover is still there but the paste has leak, but i still used the paste and it cleaned my teeth pretty nicely, product on it self is nice and it also has sparkles so that is something i liked but let‚Äôs see weather it say‚Äôs what it claims or not in a few months
Bought this toothpaste for myself and got blown away by the taste of it. It tastes amazing. It does the cleaning job well for me, as I noticed whiter teeth within a few days of usage. It also keeps me fresh throughout the day until I brush again at night so that's another W there. However, it doesn't work for my mother who has also been using it for the same amount of time. So it is good but not for everyone.
The taste is lovely and the efficacy is also good
Quality ingredients are very good it's very good like says in Shark tank feel so satisfying and clean really. The package box is damaged during to transit but is not affected the product. Fully recommended at this price point.
Excellent taste. No harsh chemicals. A genuine product
Just received the product and the packing is minimal and compact. Will reshare a detailed feedback after using the products
Its a bit expensive but it really works. Can get a large toothpaste for this price point but it does the job.
Product is great! Worked really well to remove most of the stain within a few brushes. But then its effect gets saturated.
Do not fall for this product because of the ads being played all over tv. I have been using this for a month now (brushing twice a day) but barely noticed any difference. Not worth its being sold for, would recommend the normal visible white toothpaste over this anytime.
Nice toothpaste to keep your teeth clean
It is not a good one. just for showoff... teeth will remain the same..
It is very good product for teeth.clean teeth after use of 15 days.
The product is good and the package was also good  as it was recyclable. For best results this product must be used for more than one month. The taste is not so good as tastes like acids or chlorine and also smells like chlorine in mouth but the result is good for a long time user.
The product is way too smaller as compared to the image that they are showing. It does not work on making teeth white. May be to a small extent but definitely not visible results. Plus this has made my teeth sensitive. I was never prone to sensitivity before.I would not recommend anyone to use this product.
Nice
I used 2 Colgate it's really give me a white teeth.
Nice product, feeling good after brush.

Good product. Not much refreshing but keep bad breath for few hours. Colgate Total is better.
Good product
Use twice a day for good results
It was very refreshing for me
Nice
This product has been a life changer..i was suffering from toothache from a very long time.. I used this toothpaste once and my toothache seem to have reduced. Not sure if its made for it but genuinely my mouth feels fresh and my toothache is reduced to T.
Normal toothpaste
I recently purchased Dabur Neem toothpaste from Amazon and am pleased with my experience. The price was notably lower than my local market, and the timely delivery was a bonus. The toothpaste itself has a refreshing neem flavor, leaving my mouth feeling clean. Overall, a cost-effective and convenient purchase.
Best ayurvedic product
Great pricing
Cheap in prise ,
Not so thick
value for money
Dabur also good
Pepsodent like or colgate paste like, which is just green colour. There is no much difference
Not bad, pricing is too moderate. Thanks Dabur for this Neem Toothpaste also thanks to Amazon for such better items.

Worth it
Best item
Good product.
Colgate total always better than the standard one. Higher cost but, you need to take only little bit and brush and it has been very effective for us for past many years. Clean after feeling, less tooth issues and standard product
Only use Colgate total. After 4 months you see results. No tooth decay or any dental problems which can occure with other tooth paste. No option for this
Personal use.
Regular usage completely removes sensitivity of teeth. Great feelings after usage
Good toothpaste. It lasts reasonably well but not as long as advertised. The revamped Total line no longer has triclosan that was a key ingredient in keeping bacteria at bay in the mouth (they had to drop this due to other concerns).Still good smooth, clean, refreshing and safe toothpaste.
Original small cap was better .this new colgate cap has been designed to make it stand on the sink...but there is some fungus accumulated after some days inside the cap .
Value for money
One of the best available toothpaste
I like it's minty flavor and freshness.
A great natural product cleans well like other toothpaste though you will not get foam as it does not contains chemicals like sls, good value for money if buyed wth tongue cleaner else little bit on expensive side
It does not foam as it does not have the nasty chemicals that makes other toothpaste foam and gives false sense of freshness. Just the price is on a higher side.
This Toothpaste is Amazing. It has no Fluoride and contains only Natural Ingredients . After Brushing teeth the teeth feel firmer , the gums feel stronger and the Breath is Fresh. I have used a lot of Toothpastes in my life and I reckon that I have stumbled on this Miraculous Product which is Truly AYURVEDIC. Salute to the Manufacturer for bringing out this Product.
Tube has no details of manufacturer. It gas some European language printed. Why not safe in children below 6? Looks costly. Rest looks good to use.
Maharishi Ayurveda Ayurdent Classic Ayurvedic Herbal Toothpaste is a pure and authentic oral care gem. It stands out for its natural ingredients, free from SLS and fluoride, making it a healthier choice. The herbal blend leaves my mouth feeling remarkably fresh and clean after each use. What's impressive is that it's a product of Europe, which adds to its credibility. This toothpaste seamlessly combines the wisdom of Ayurveda with modern dental care needs, making it a staple in my daily routine. For those seeking a natural, refreshing, and effective toothpaste, Ayurdent Classic is a top-notch choice.
Product is good. As far as quantity is concerned, the product is pricy.
I have used this toothpaste for 3 months and writing review now. My teeth has turned yellow after using it. I'll not recommend this product to anyone. I had bought this after watching fit tuber video, but it's extremely bad product. Save your money don't buy this.
Amazing but only brush your teeth with ultra soft toothbrush only for 2 min twice a day.
Good herbal toothpaste . A bit spicy .
Really good toothpaste
Does it's job
It's good quality tooth paste.
I can say, the best amongst the category....
Feels like another regular toothpaste. Cost is on a bit higher side but still better than Sensodyne and others. Don't expect it to make your teeth whiter. Ok for regular use. Gives freshness for 3-4 hours max, Sensodyne used to give freshness upto 4-5 hours. Dabur Meswak would give freshness to 2.5 to 4 hours.In terms of gentleness: Dabur Meswak > Himalaya sparkling white> Sensodyne.But Sensodyne gave me best result for my sensitive teeth and gums.This Himalaya one and Dabur Meswak are okay for regular use.
It's a boon for me and my family because my 5years kid doesn't use paste. She just brushes without paste. But when Amazon delivered this paste I forcibly brushed her. At first, she cried and beat me but later she said it was good I wanted only this. For 15 days she is brushing with paste. Thanks a lot, Amazon and Himalaya.I forcibly tried most brands to brush her but she never wanted to brush again with those.
Daily use paste. Cleaning good. But price little high.
Updated - the toothpaste really works. It really improved the shade of the teeth like a charm. I recommend this toothpaste highly to everyone.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîReceived this product today in the morning only, just next day after ordering with prime delivery and with great packaging as always. The first trial of the product was good though there was no change in the shade of the teeth which was expected as it is chemical free, but the taste is good and freshness in the breath. Will update the review after two weeks of usage on the whitening as it claims whitening of the teeth in two weeks.Pros-1. Herbal. No chemical used2. Good in taste3. Fresh breath4. No burning sensation in tongue or mouth which I generally feel when I switch to new tooth paste, probably because of the chemicals in them.5. Very Reasonable price if it really gives you a sparkling teeth in two weeks.
never seen other products like closeup and Colgate getting even 10-20 % closer to their promises in regards to their products, as this himalaya Toothpaste also controls the bad breath and improves your breath and fights upto 16-18 hours and if used with himalaya's hiora mouthwash the results can be extended upto by 20 hours in total so Value for money and best thing is it really whitens teeths and can be seen after the initial 3-5 days, but I started seeing since my first day so definitely both thumbs up and I guess I found the Toothpaste for eternity
Dental use
Good feels moth fresh long time after brush
Great product
Quality is very good.
Good quality
I used buy Red always, thought of trying neem and to my dismay this paste is average and awful taste, doesnt feel like a neem paste, more like a cream used for Cakes.

It is very good for instant sensitivity / slight pain  relief.
I have used all of Sensodyne Colgate but among them Sensodyne Rapid Relief is the best, you can also use Repair and Protect if you want.
Best branded toothpaste at competitive rates suitable for sensitive teeth to stay free from tooth pain...üëç
It's working
It helps temporary
Believe me, Sensodyne Rapid Relief Tooth Paste works miraculously.
Worthy for money
Best for sensitive
I am not great fan of mint flavour, so I was super excited to try 'Cardamom' FLAVOUR, and guess what i wanted to eat it after trying, so just go for it(who all are looking to buy a natural toothpaste), and its not too much foamy like other chemical based toothpaste, but yes you can brush easily and get good amount of little foam(in 15-25 seconds).You can try first doing a gentle massage with a pea amount of paste, and then brush lightly, results are amaiiiizing, souperbbAnd it's so refreshing and so natural, god thankyou to you all who made this amazing product.Yes now i am excited about mint flavour too!Talking about packaging, it was properly boxed, outside box was also in good condition, i m not throwing the box, my one additional toothpaste is gonna stay there untill i use my first toothpaste.
If someone is looking for chemical free toothpaste then its a good product.
I like the product have used it for 6 months now and liking it it tastes good
Product is fine I think I have found this toothpaste one in it‚Äôs kind that doesn‚Äôt have any chemicals in it. But at least use some ayurvedic things in it clove or something more like dant Mannan type
Pure organic
It produces less foam and tastes better than Colgate and pepsodent , i really appreciate for this. But it's Little bit expensive from others.
No foam at all. Good as advertised
Feels fresh even after 8 hours. Far good than other popular products
Its good keep it up.
Feels good to use SLS and praben free toothpaste...made my teeth yellow I think
The kids love it.Please use only pea size as they tend to swallow the toothpaste .very happy with the purchase.
Perfect product for children.
It's tastes well as my kid enjoys brushing using this pasteCan be Tension free as they do not use any kind of hamrful ingredients for making Tooth paste and it's of great quality
My kid like the taste
My son loves using this and enjoys brushing his teeth
Kid doesn't like the taste.
Thank you mama Earth for best thooth paste for gids.
Good one
My children like th toothpaste
Good
I have been using this toothpastefor almost a week now and I can honestly say it's the best stain remover oral product I have used. I have been using twice daily and can already feel benefits of the quality stain removal and whitening. The flavour of this toothpaste is one I really like and gives you that long-lasting freshness. I am a big coffee drinker and have found that over time my teeth are not as white as they once was and I do have a bit of staining on the inside of my bottom teeth. I can already see that my teeth are looking healthier and stronger even after 1 week of use. Having the stain prevention within this toothpaste is really appealing, as it's nice to know that your teeth will not just return to how they was after a period of time. Im feeling much more confident and I know in time my teeth will just keep on looking better and better. This toothpaste is definitely an expertly made product and I would highly recommend to all.
My dentist recommended me this tooth paste. It is very good at removing plaque. Not sure about teeth whitening maybe just a shade lighter do not expect more.
Very Good Product.
I had to throw it . It‚Äôs that bad .
Good really works
I recently tried this teeth whitening toothpaste, and I'm thrilled with the results! The minty flavor is refreshing, and after just a week of use, I noticed a significant improvement in the brightness of my smile. I highly recommend it.
Notbad
Really great toothpaste......... after and during brushing the whole of inside of mouth feels highly fresh ...
It is used to brush the teeth
Yes, it worked. I was doing the trial as i was usnig pepsodent whitening. Since due to the shortage of pesodent, i was searching for an alternate. And yes, its satisfactory. You can use this for whitening purpose.
Toothpaste quality was too good.

Want again and again purches
Nice
My gums and teeth are now firm.
I really don't know how much beneficial it is for teeth, but overall experience is good. Only negative point I would like to mention that it's excessively highly priced considering the quantity.
The toothpaste box was all malingled. Luckily the toothpaste was not damaged.
Items in good conditionTaste and fresh compared to peer companies.
Nice product
This a good product. I have been using this toothpaste for the ten years
Exellent
1. Lemon extract available2. Clean teeth properly3. PPM available4. Gives whitening more than other toothpests.
Good
Nice product
Value for money
Simply 100 percent effective
Really effective
With toothpastes being sweet its so nice to finally have a fruit flavoured balanced salt paste, this is a must buy
Reduced cavity
It's a regular Colgate salt with the lemon extract enhancing its flavour.
We use this one from last 7-8 yrs. It's feeling comfortable in teeth problem like sensitivities with hot and cold water.
Product was good but delivery is from DTDC and they denied to deliver at the address saying that we don't deliver there. Then I had to visit at their location and collected the same
good tooth paste but difficult to precure in my area
It has all... Value for the price and gentle towards your teeth and the credibility of Colgate
If you need a paste to control sensitivity, definitely it is recommended. Flavor is also nice and does not irritates mouth. I am using the paste along with the Electric tooth brush. I was expecting this one to be somewhat similar to Sensodyne. But this is just ok, not as best as Sensodyne.  May be my expectation is high.
Light taste, fresh, good for old people
Good
At first, I used to think these so-called toothpastes for "sensitivity" were cheap marketing gimmicks.  No, I was wrong, they are effective.  For immediate pain relief, you can just apply on the affected tooth and massage with your finger for two minutes.  After two months of use like a regular toothpaste, the tooth sensitivity completely disappears.  I even noticed that it halts further progression of gumline recession.  The mild clove oil flavour leaves your breath fresh.  I intend to use this forever for complete teeth protection.
Good üëç
The toothpaste causes multiple reactive ulcers in mouth which are painful. Not Suited to long term use. Colgate sensitive white is still better. Colgate sensitive blue gel is worthless waste of money.
The product provides a very premium experience. Very good taste and smell. But need time to get used to it as it does not produce foam. Also experienced significant whitening.
Its the great natural product, the different flavors are nice and the after-taste is soothing. You can feel the freshness post brushing.
I just bought this toothpaste and it does wonders for me. Feels quite refreshing and healthy ingredients makes me much more happy. Price is little on a higher side but product is of good quality.
The toothpaste is effective, refreshing and yummy!

I order 3 variants. All of them are good. Good taste and refreshing  flavours. Price is bit on higher side. Rest all ok
I just love this product. There are 2 reason. 1- It is SLS free and immensely refreshing.2. Taste is also really good.
We were looking for chemical free / sls free toothpaste and finally found a good one.I think kids can also use it since it is free of harmful chemicals. Good and cool looking productüòä
Unwind toothpaste is the best solution before going to bed , suttle and simple. Awake can have better taste that is what I feel.
Mast hai‚Ä¶ didnt expect k taste accha lagega‚Ä¶ vrna meri biwi ko to bhut nakhre hai‚Ä¶And mouth feels refreshing after use‚Ä¶ obviously expensive if compared to others but its vegan, sls free and blah blah so maybe its justified.
Nice
Paste is very fine but delivery boy took cash from even I already had paid the amount online
Product is very refreshing & cleansing is superb
Highly Recommended for those who has sensitive teeth.
It is good
Value for money, quality is good
Good paste I am using Amway product since 10 years
                    The media could not be loaded.                ¬†It's creating an confusion
My mom have diabetes plus lack of calcium so her teeths have some cavities hence dentist recommended this  she is using it for many years now , it's working way better for cavities and whitening
Better than market rate.
The product looks to be fresh from the dealer
It is a good product
Colgate herbal is having the green tag which means it‚Äôs having natural herbal ingredients. Great refreshing mint flavor and kids also love it
Quality products and good discounts
The amount of herbs used in this toothpaste seems very less, as I cannot find any herbal feel in my mouth after brushing. I brush two times daily and I don't think I will buy this again. It feels like any other regular toothpaste, nothing like herbal.
I had been using Colgate MaxFresh until now. After using Colgate Herbal teeth and gums are feeling so much better, that I am going to use it for many many years.Colgate Herbal has many herbs like --1. Eucalyptus Oil - it protects from cavities, plaque, gingivitis and infections.2. Tea Tree Oil - it is natural anti-bacterial herb.3. Chamomile - it decreases pain, swelling and fights tooth decay.4. Sage - for keeping teeth white and freshening breath.5. Myrrh - protects from dental infections and promotes healthy gums.If you have any teeth problems, then definitely give this a try. If your teeth are already healthy, then this toothpaste will protect them from any teeth diseases.Best thing is that it does not contain formaldehyde like some other Ayurvedic toothpastes (Formaldehyde is known to cause cancer). So it is completely natural and safe.
Analysis:It does contains herbal extracts, so calling is herbal is not wrong. Almost everything which is sold as natural and herbal does contain other chemicals which act as preservatives. Even most touted brand of India, Patanjali has chemicals in its products.Base of all toothpaste is same.Now as far as this one goes, my sister was curious about this paste , so was I . So I ordered it, I already have tried vedshakti and patanjali and dabur. Taste is nice, if you have used miswak toothpaste, taste is like that.I do not really have anything to complain.RealityIt is not medically proven , there is no research available which states that this product is better than others and performs better than others. Other than flavor , it cannot really be said that it is as better than others as advertised.VerdictWell I do recommend this product, do try it out, it has nice flavor to it.I hope that my review helped you. If you have any other question fell free to comment below or message me directly. I will  be glad to assist you and answer all your queries.
I love this particular Colgate toothpaste for it's mildness . It's comparatively cheaper than other Colgate toothpastes which is an added bonus. It's so mild that you can comfortably brush your teeth taking all the time you need without feeling the need to spit it out! It's mild so good one to introduce to small kids who've learned to brush teeth properly without swallowing the toothpastes!
A good product
If you are looking for a toothpaste at an affordable price and regular use. This is the perfect buy for normal regular brushing. Not recommended to person with sensative teeth. And this combo package is better then single ones.
But takes time to get adjusted to coming from standard toothpastes. Normal toothpastes give a freshness feel instantly but this paste takes some time to getting used to. It took me about one and half months to getting used to and after that this also feels fresh.
Good qualityGood taste
I was looking for a toothpaste without sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS), which is used as a foaming agent in most toothpastes including so-called herbal ones. Reason for this is that I recently developed mouth ulcers inexplicably, and after research online concluded that SLS might be one of the factors preventing healing of the ulcers.My search finally brought me to Bentodent and I am really glad I ordered it. Love the elaichi flavour and the earthy feel. Foaming is much less than other toothpastes, but more than adequate. Feels clean and fresh after brushing.First two days had a bit of a problem with the toothpaste falling off the brush, but soon solved that problem by pressing in the edge of the extruded toothpaste onto the brush with the tip of the tube itself.Ulcers have now healed, but will continue with Bentodent. Love it!
Have been using this paste for sometime now and really liked it. But gradually they are reducing quantity and there is more of air. Have again ordered today 9.2.24, if I find the same again, this may be my last order and will switch to some other product
Very nice üëå
100% natural organic toothpaste, no chemicals... I have been using it for 2 months ... I am seeing a change , there were slight gaps between my teeths .. I can feel the gap is getting fulfil gradually ..Nice toothpaste go for it.. üëç
Have been using this toothpaste for a year now. Very happy with the results. I had surmountable insensitivity of the teeth, sensodyne worsened it and this tooth paste has worked like magic.
It is Really Waste Product, It doesn't Feel Like I brush my Teeth after Brushing.Trust me guys,Plz don't waste money

The toothpaste leaves a refreshing mouth-feel after use. It has a long lasting freshness when compared to the peers. Highly recommended and one will feel the difference post usage.
The label says it contains laung, tulsi, kapoor, chandan, mulethi etc.  Entire havan samagri in one convenient paste. Go for it if you have a pooja coming up.
